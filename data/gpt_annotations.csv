7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors 

Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole, may inhibit enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism (CYP24A1 and CYP27B1), and may alter serum levels of calcifediol.  Dose adjustment of RAYALDEE may be required, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.








7.2 Thiazides 

Thiazides are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine.
Concomitant administration of thiazides with RAYALDEE may cause hypercalcemia.  Patients may require more frequent serum calcium monitoring in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Drug interaction studies have been completed with INVIRASE and saquinavir mesylate capsules (hard gel and soft gel). Observations from drug interaction studies with saquinavir mesylate capsules (soft gel) may not be predictive for INVIRASE/ritonavir. Because ritonavir is coadministered with INVIRASE, prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for ritonavir regarding drug interactions associated with this agent.






INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, significantly increasing the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. (7.1)
Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir with drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced efficacy. (7.2)
Certain drugs or drug classes should not be coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir based on drug interaction studies or predicted drug interactions. (5.2, 7.2, 7.3)








7.1      Potential for INVIRASE/Ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

The combination INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and may significantly increase the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Drugs that are contraindicated specifically due to the observed or expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious or life-threatening adverse events are listed in Section 4 Contraindications [see Contraindications (4)]. Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring (see 
Table 2
).








7.2      Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVIRASE/Ritonavir

The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated primarily by CYP3A. Additionally, saquinavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, drugs that affect CYP3A and/or P-gp may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Coadministration with drugs that are potent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced therapeutic effect.








7.3      Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Based on the finding of dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals in healthy volunteers receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir, additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with certain members of the following drug classes: antiarrhythmics class IA or class III, neuroleptics, antidepressants, PDE5 inhibitors (when used for pulmonary arterial hypertension), antimicrobials, antihistaminics and others. This effect might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, notably torsade de pointes. Therefore, concurrent administration of these agents with INVIRASE/ritonavir is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

FARYDAK® (panobinostat) capsules, for oral use

Initial U.S. Approval: 2015",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Panobinostat is a CYP3A substrate and inhibits CYP2D6. Panobinostat is a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter system substrate.






Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors: Reduce FARYDAK dose. (7.1)
Strong CYP3A4 inducers:  Avoid concomitant use with FARYDAK. (7.2)
Sensitive CYP2D6 substrates:  Avoid concomitant use with FARYDAK. (7.3)
Anti-arrhythmic drugs/QT-prolonging drugs: Avoid concomitant use. (7.4) 








7.1 Agents that May Increase FARYDAK Blood Concentrations


CYP3A Inhibitors: Coadministration of FARYDAK with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased the Cmax and AUC of panobinostat by 62% and 73% respectively, compared to when FARYDAK was given alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Reduce dose to 10 mg when coadministered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Instruct patients to avoid star fruit, pomegranate or pomegranate juice, and grapefruit or grapefruit juice because these foods are known to inhibit CYP3A enzymes.








7.2 Agents that May Decrease FARYDAK Plasma Concentrations


CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of FARYDAK with strong CYP3A inducers was not evaluated in vitro or in a clinical trial however, a reduction in panobinostat exposure is likely. An approximately 70% decrease in the systemic exposure of panobinostat in the presence of strong inducers of CYP3A was observed in simulations using mechanistic models. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 Agents whose Plasma Concentrations May be Increased by FARYDAK


CYP2D6 Substrates: FARYDAK increased the median Cmax and AUC of a sensitive substrate of CYP2D6 by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively; however this was highly variable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministrating FARYDAK with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (i.e., atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, and venlafaxine) or CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., thioridazine, pimozide). If concomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates is unavoidable, monitor patients frequently for adverse reactions.

TYBOST® (cobicistat) tablets, for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 2012",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS




TYBOST, in combination with atazanavir or darunavir, can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of TYBOST, atazanavir and darunavir. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (4, 5.3, 7, 12.3)







7.1	Potential Effect of Cobicistat (Coadministered with Atazanavir or Darunavir) on the Pharmacokinetics of Concomitant Drugs

Cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6. The transporters that cobicistat inhibits include p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. The plasma concentration of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 may be increased if those drugs are coadministered with TYBOST.
Based on in vitro data, cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 and based on in vivo data, cobicistat is not expected to induce MDR1 or, in general, CYP3A to a clinically significant extent. The induction effect of cobicistat on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 is unknown, but is expected to be low based on CYP3A in vitro induction data.
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Coadministration with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s). Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 6.








7.2	Potential Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Cobicistat (Coadministered with Atazanavir or Darunavir)

Cobicistat is metabolized by CYP3A, and to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Atazanavir and darunavir are also metabolized by CYP3A.
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir in combination with drugs that induce CYP3A activity have the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of cobicistat, atazanavir, and darunavir, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance (see Table 6).
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir in combination with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may further increase the plasma concentrations of cobicistat, atazanavir, and darunavir (see Table 6).








7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions

Coadministration of TYBOST with fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir is not recommended because pharmacokinetic data are not available to provide appropriate dosing recommendations. Use of TYBOST with lopinavir is not recommended because lopinavir is co-formulated with ritonavir.
Table 6 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir or darunavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Table 6, if not specifically stated, the drug interaction information applies to both coadministered agents: TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir or darunavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
In addition to the drug interactions noted in Table 6, TYBOST is not recommended for use in combination with fixed-dose combination tablets that contain cobicistat, lopinavir/ritonavir or regimens containing ritonavir, or in combination with more than one antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Evaluate whether dosing adjustments of concomitant medications or coadministered antiretroviral drugs are necessary in:

Patients on a stable concomitant medication who initiate or switch to a TYBOST-containing regimen
Patients on a TYBOST-containing regimen who initiate a new concomitant medication
Patients initiating a TYBOST-containing regimen and a new concomitant medication simultaneously

Under these circumstances, also monitor for adverse events and/or monitor concentrations of concomitant medications if appropriate.
No dose adjustment is required when TDF or rilpivirine are coadministered with TYBOST and atazanavir or darunavir.

ACE-inhibitors






Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors. 










Aspirin






When meclofenamate sodium in administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free meclofenamate sodium is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meclofenamate sodium capsules and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects. 










Furosemide







Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that meclofenamate sodium can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS: Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. 










Lithium






NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. 










Methotrexate






NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. 










Warfarin






The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.","ACE-inhibitors, Aspirin, Furosemide, Lithium, Methotrexate, Warfarin"

Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with ADDYI






Alcohol





Clinical Implications 


The coadministration of ADDYI with alcohol increased the risk of hypotension, syncope, and CNS depression compared to the use of ADDYI alone or alcohol alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].





Preventing or Managing DI 


Counsel patients to wait at least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime or to skip their ADDYI dose if they have consumed three or more alcoholic drinks that evening. [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].





Other CNS Depressants 





Examples 


Diphenhydramine, opioids, hypnotics, benzodiazepines 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CNS depressants may increase the risk of CNS depression (e.g., somnolence) compared to the use of ADDYI alone. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the concomitant use of other CNS depressants with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors





Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 


Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin and conivaptan 




Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 


Amprenavir, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, and grapefruit juice 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases flibanserin exposure compared to the use of ADDYI alone. The risk of hypotension and syncope is increased with concomitant use of ADDYI and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Preventing or Managing DI 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. 






Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors





Examples 


Oral contraceptives, cimetidine, fluoxetine, ginkgo, ranitidine 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of adverse reactions. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the use of multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





Strong CYP2C19 Inhibitors





Examples 


Proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, antifungals 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors may increase flibanserin exposure which may increase the risk of hypotension, syncope, and CNS depression. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the use of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





CYP3A4 Inducers





Examples 


Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapetine, St. John's Wort 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CYP3A4 inducers substantially decreases flibanserin exposure compared to the use of ADDYI alone. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. 





Digoxin or Other P-glycoprotein Substrates





Examples 


Digoxin, sirolimus 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with digoxin, a drug that is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), increases the digoxin concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may lead to digoxin toxicity. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Increase monitoring of concentrations of drugs transported by P-gp that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin).

Reduced cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity, drugs which inhibit this isozyme (e.g., fluoxetine and paroxetine), and certain other drugs (e.g., fluvoxamine, propranolol, and pindolol) appear to appreciably inhibit the metabolism of thioridazine. The resulting elevated levels of thioridazine would be expected to augment the prolongation of the QTc interval associated with thioridazine and may increase the risk of serious, potentially fatal, cardiac arrhythmias, such as Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias. Such an increased risk may result also from the additive effect of coadministering thioridazine with other agents that prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, thioridazine is contraindicated with these drugs as well as in patients, comprising about 7% of the normal population, who are known to have a genetic defect leading to reduced levels of activity of P450 2D6 (see 
         
 
  WARNINGS and 
         
 
  CONTRAINDICATIONS).
        

 








Drugs That Inhibit Cytochrome P450 2D6



In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C
           
 
  max and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared to rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 or the presence of reduced activity levels of this isozyme will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. Therefore, the coadministration of drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 with thioridazine and the use of thioridazine in patients known to have reduced activity of P450 2D6 are contraindicated.
          

 










Drugs That Reduce the Clearance of Thioridazine Through Other Mechanisms








Fluvoxamine 


The effect of fluvoxamine (25 mg b.i.d. for one week) on thioridazine steady-state concentration was evaluated in ten male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased 3-fold following coadministration of fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine and thioridazine should not be coadministered.









Propranolol 


Concurrent administration of propranolol (100 mg to 800 mg daily) has been reported to produce increases in plasma levels of thioridazine (approximately 50% to 400%) and its metabolites (approximately 80% to 300%). Propranolol and thioridazine should not be coadministered.









Pindolol 


Concurrent administration of pindolol and thioridazine have resulted in moderate, dose related increases in the serum levels of thioridazine and two of its metabolites, as well as higher than expected serum pindolol levels. Pindolol and thioridazine should not be coadministered.












Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval



There are no studies of the coadministration of thioridazine and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. However, it is expected that such coadministration would produce additive prolongation of the QTc interval and, thus, such use is contraindicated.","fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, propranolol, pindolol"

Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors

VONJO is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. In a clinical drug interaction study, a single-dose of VONJO 400 mg was administered following treatment with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Clarithromycin was administered as 500 mg twice daily for 5 days, which is a submaximal regimen for CYP3A4 inhibition. Compared to VONJO administered alone, the area under the concentration curve (AUC) and maximal concentration (Cmax) of pacritinib increased by 80% and 30%, respectively, upon coadministration with clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The increase in exposure to pacritinib may be even higher when tested following a longer treatment with clarithromycin that results in maximal CYP3A4 inhibition. The impact of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of VONJO has not been investigated in clinical studies. Co-administration of VONJO with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Avoid concomitant use of VONJO with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Several studies investigated the possible interaction between miglitol and glyburide. In six healthy volunteers given a single dose of 5 mg glyburide on a background of 6 days treatment with miglitol (50 mg 3 times daily for 4 days followed by 100 mg 3 times daily for 2 days) or placebo, the mean C    max and AUC values for glyburide were 17% and 25% lower, respectively, when glyburide was given with miglitol. In a study in diabetic patients in which the effects of adding miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days or placebo to a background regimen of 3.5 mg glyburide daily were investigated, the mean AUC value for glyburide was 18% lower in the group treated with miglitol, although this difference was not statistically significant. Information on a potential interaction with glyburide was obtained from one of the large U.S. clinical trials (Study 7) in which patients were dosed with either miglitol or placebo on a background of glyburide 10 mg twice daily. At the 6-month and 1-year clinic visits, patients taking concomitant miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily exhibited mean C    max values for glyburide that were 16% and 8% lower, respectively, compared to patients taking glyburide alone. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Thus, although there was a trend toward lower AUC and C    max values for glyburide when co-administered with miglitol tablets, no definitive statement regarding a potential interaction can be made based on the foregoing three studies.  
The effect of miglitol (100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1000 mg dose of metformin was investigated in healthy volunteers. Mean AUC and C    max values for metformin were 12% to 13% lower when the volunteers were given miglitol as compared with placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant.  
In a study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of either 50 mg or 100 mg miglitol 3 times daily together with digoxin reduced the average plasma concentrations of digoxin by 19% and 28%, respectively. However, in diabetic patients under treatment with digoxin, plasma digoxin concentrations were not altered by co-administration of miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily for 14 days.
Other healthy volunteer studies have demonstrated that miglitol may significantly reduce the bioavailability of ranitidine and propranolol by 60% and 40%, respectively. No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either warfarin or nifedipine.
Intestinal adsorbents (e.g., charcoal) and digestive enzyme preparations containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes (e.g., amylase, pancreatin) may reduce the effect of miglitol tablets and should not be taken concomitantly.

Potential interactions between Cesamet 2 mg, and diazepam 5 mg; sodium secobarbital 100 mg; alcohol 45 mL (absolute laboratory alcohol); or codeine 65 mg, were evaluated in 15 subjects. Only a single combination was utilized at any one time. The subjects were evaluated according to physiologic (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure), psychometric, psychomotor, and subjective parameters. In this study, as expected, the depressant effects of the combinations were additive. Psychomotor function was particularly impaired with concurrent use of diazepam. Caution must thus be used when administering nabilone in combination with any CNS depressant.
Nabilone is purportedly highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace other protein-bound drugs. Therefore, practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering nabilone to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs.

The unusual vulnerability of the dog to Cesamet is not understood; it is hypothesized, however, that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species in its metabolism of Cesamet.","diazepam, sodium secobarbital, alcohol, codeine, amphetamines, cocaine, other sympathomimetic agents, atropine, scopolamine, antihistamines, other anticholinergic agents, amitriptyline, amoxapine, desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ethanol, lithium, opioids, buspirone, muscle relaxants, other CNS depressants, disulfiram, fluoxetine, antipyrine, theophylline, naltrexone"

Co-administration of APTIVUS can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of tipranavir.  The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 5.3, 7)







7.1  Potential for APTIVUS/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir at the recommended dose is a net inhibitor of CYP 3A and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP 3A. Thus, co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP 3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)
]. Co-administration with other CYP 3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7)
].
Clinically significant drug-drug interactions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir are summarized in Table 4 below. 
A phenotypic cocktail study was conducted with 16 healthy volunteers to quantify the influence of 10 days of APTIVUS/ritonavir capsule administration on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2D6 (dextromethorphan) and the activity of intestinal and hepatic CYP 3A4/5 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin).  This study determined the first-dose and steady-state effects of 500 mg of APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir twice daily in capsule form. APTIVUS oral solution co-administered with ritonavir capsules demonstrated similar effects as APTIVUS capsules co-administrated with ritonavir.
There was no net effect on CYP 2C9 or hepatic P-gp at first dose or steady state.  There was no net effect after first dose on CYP 1A2, but there was moderate induction at steady state.  There was modest inhibition of CYP 2C19 at the first dose, but there was marked induction at steady state.  Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4/5 activities were observed after first dose and steady state. 
Intestinal and hepatic P-gp activity was assessed by administering oral and intravenous digoxin, respectively.  The digoxin results indicate P-gp was inhibited after the first dose of APTIVUS/ritonavir followed by induction of P-gp over time. Thus, it is difficult to predict the net effect of APTIVUS administered with ritonavir on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations of drugs that are dual substrates of CYP 3A and P-gp. The net effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administered drugs for CYP 3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-pass metabolism/efflux.  An in vitro induction study in human hepatocytes showed an increase in UGT1A1 by tipranavir similar to that evoked by rifampin.  The clinical consequences of this finding have not been established.








7.2  Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tipranavir 

Tipranavir is a CYP 3A substrate and a P-gp substrate. Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that induce CYP 3A and/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir plasma concentrations. Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavir plasma concentrations.  Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir with drugs that inhibit CYP 3A may not further increase tipranavir plasma concentrations, because the level of metabolites is low following steady-state administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily. 
Clinically significant drug-drug interactions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir are summarized in Table 4 below.

Based on theoretical considerations itraconazole and ketoconazole should be used with caution.  High doses (>200 mg/day) are not recommended.



↕ Voriconazole (not studied)





Due to multiple enzymes involved with voriconazole metabolism, it is difficult to predict the interaction.



Antimycobacterials:





Clarithromycin
↑ Tipranavir, ↑ Clarithromycin,↓ 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin metabolite
No dose adjustment of APTIVUS or clarithromycin for patients with normal renal function is necessary.




For patients with renal impairment the following dosage adjustments should be considered: 									
For patients with CLCR 30 to 60 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be reduced by 50%.
For patients with CLCR <30 mL/min the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 75%. 




Rifabutin
Tipranavir not changed, ↑Rifabutin↑ Desacetyl-rifabutin
Single dose study.  Dosage reductions of rifabutin by 75% are recommended (e.g., 150 mg every other day).  Increased monitoring for adverse events in patients receiving the combination is warranted. Further dosage reduction may be necessary. 


Other Agents Commonly Used





Anticonvulsants:





CarbamazepinePhenobarbitalPhenytoin
↓ Tipranavir
Caution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital and/or phenytoin.  APTIVUS may be less effective due to decreased tipranavir plasma concentration in patients taking these agents concomitantly.


Valproic Acid
↓ Valproic Acid
Caution should be used when prescribing valproic acid.  Valproic acid may be less effective due to decreased valproic acid plasma concentration in patients taking APTIVUS concomitantly.



Antidepressants:





Trazodone
↑ Trazodone
Concomitant use of trazodone and APTIVUS/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone.  Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope have been observed following co-administration of trazodone and ritonavir.  If trazodone is used with a CYP 3A4 inhibitor such as APTIVUS/ritonavir, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.


Desipramine
Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied↑ Desipramine
Dosage reduction and concentration monitoring of desipramine is recommended.

Treatment of gout flares:  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:

0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than 3 days.







Prophylaxis of gout flares:  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir: 									
If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day.
If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.







Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF):  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:

Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).





Antipsychotics:





Quetiapine
↑ Quetiapine

Initiation of APTIVUS with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine:





Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.





Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking APTIVUS with ritonavir: 





Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. 



Benzodiazepines:





Parenterally administered midazolam 
↑ Midazolam
Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4. Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration.  Therefore, APTIVUS should not be given with orally administered midazolam [see Contraindications (4)
]. If APTIVUS is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustments should be considered.


Buprenorphine/naloxone
↔ Buprenorphine↓ Tipranavir
APTIVUS/ritonavir did not result in changes in the clinical efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone.  Compared to historical controls tipranavir Cmin  was decreased approximately 40% with this combination.  Dose adjustments cannot be recommended.



Calcium Channel Blockers:

Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied. Cannot predict effect of TPV/ritonavir on calcium channel blockers that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp due to conflicting effect of TPV/ritonavir on CYP3A and P-gp.
Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended.

Concurrent administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia.



Inhaled/Nasal Steroids:





Fluticasone
↑ Fluticasone
Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and APTIVUS/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Co-administration of fluticasone propionate and APTIVUS/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.



Narcotic Analgesics:






Combinations with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied
Dosage increase and long-term use of meperidine are not recommended due to increased concentrations of the metabolite normeperidine which has both analgesic activity and CNS stimulant activity (e.g., seizures).


Meperidine

In vitro, nilutamide has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and, therefore, may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems.
Consequently, drugs with a low therapeutic margin, such as vitamin K antagonists, phenytoin, and theophylline, could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum half-life leading to a toxic level. The dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with nilutamide. For example, when vitamin K antagonists are administered concomitantly with nilutamide, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and, if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced.","vitamin K antagonists, phenytoin, theophylline"

Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein


Because nefazodone is highly bound to plasma protein (see 

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY


,


 Pharmacokinetics

), administration of nefazodone to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of nefazodone by other highly bound drugs.
Warfarin – There were no effects on the prothrombin or bleeding times or upon the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin when nefazodone (200 mg BID) was administered for 1 week to subjects who had been pretreated for 2 weeks with warfarin. Although the coadministration of nefazodone did decrease the subjects’ exposure to S-warfarin by 12%, the lack of effects on the prothrombin and bleeding times indicates this modest change is not clinically significant. Although these results suggest no adjustments in warfarin dosage are required when nefazodone is administered to patients stabilized on warfarin, such patients should be monitored as required by standard medical practices.









CNS-Active Drugs


Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors – See 
WARNINGS
.
Haloperidol – When a single oral 5 mg dose of haloperidol was coadministered with nefazodone (200 mg BID) at steady state, haloperidol apparent clearance decreased by 35% with no significant increase in peak haloperidol plasma concentrations or time of peak. This change is of unknown clinical significance. Pharmacodynamic effects of haloperidol were generally not altered significantly. There were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for nefazodone. Dosage adjustment of haloperidol may be necessary when coadministered with nefazodone.
Lorazepam – When lorazepam (2 mg BID) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were coadministered to steady state, there was no change in any pharmacokinetic parameter for either drug compared to each drug administered alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.
Triazolam/Alprazolam – See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
.
Alcohol – Although nefazodone did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of nefazodone and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.
Buspirone – In a study of steady-state pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (2.5 or 5 mg BID) with nefazodone (250 mg BID) resulted in marked increases in plasma buspirone concentrations (increases up to 20 fold in Cmax and up to 50 fold in AUC) and statistically significant decreases (about 50%) in plasma concentrations of the buspirone metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine. With 5 mg BID doses of buspirone, slight increases in AUC were observed for nefazodone (23%) and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (17%) and mCPP (9%). Subjects receiving nefazodone 250 mg BID and buspirone 5 mg BID experienced lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence, adverse events also observed with either drug alone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5 mg QD) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment.

CONTRAINDICATIONS
, 
WARNINGS
, and 
PRECAUTIONS
, Pharmacokinetics of Nefazodone in ‘Poor Metabolizers’ and Potential Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit and/or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes.

Fluoxetine – When fluoxetine (20 mg QD) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were administered at steady state there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine or its metabolite, norfluoxetine. Similarly, there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of nefazodone or HO-NEF; however, the mean AUC levels of the nefazodone metabolites mCPP and triazole-dione increased by 3 to 6 fold and 1.3 fold, respectively. When a 200 mg dose of nefazodone was administered to subjects who had been receiving fluoxetine for 1 week, there was an increased incidence of transient adverse events such as headache, lightheadedness, nausea, or paresthesia, possibly due to the elevated mCPP levels. Patients who are switched from fluoxetine to nefazodone without an adequate washout period may experience similar transient adverse events. The possibility of this happening can be minimized by allowing a washout period before initiating nefazodone therapy and by reducing the initial dose of nefazodone. Because of the long half-life of fluoxetine and its metabolites, this washout period may range from one to several weeks depending on the dose of fluoxetine and other individual patient variables.
Phenytoin – Pretreatment for 7 days with 200 mg BID of nefazodone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg oral dose of phenytoin. However, due to the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, the failure to observe a significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of phenytoin does not preclude the possibility of a clinically significant interaction with nefazodone when phenytoin is dosed chronically. However, no change in the initial dosage of phenytoin is considered necessary and any subsequent adjustment of phenytoin dosage should be guided by usual clinical practices.
Desipramine – When nefazodone (150 mg BID) and desipramine (75 mg QD) were administered together there were no changes in the pharmacokinetics of desipramine or its metabolite, 2-hydroxy desipramine. There were also no changes in the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone or its triazole-dione metabolite, but the AUC and Cmax of mCPP increased by 44% and 48%, respectively, while the AUC of HO-NEF decreased by 19%. No changes in doses of either nefazodone or desipramine are necessary when the two drugs are given concomitantly. Subsequent dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.
Lithium – In 13 healthy subjects the coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) with lithium (500 mg BID) for 5 days (steady-state conditions) was found to be well tolerated. When the two drugs were coadministered, there were no changes in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either lithium, nefazodone, or its metabolite HO-NEF; however, there were small decreases in the steady-state plasma concentrations of two nefazodone metabolites, mCPP and triazole-dione, which are considered not to be of clinical significance. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of either lithium or nefazodone is required when they are coadministered.
Carbamazepine – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) for 5 days to 12 healthy subjects on carbamazepine who had achieved steady state (200 mg BID) was found to be well tolerated. Steady-state conditions for carbamazepine, nefazodone, and several of their metabolites were achieved by day 5 of coadministration. With coadministration of the two drugs there were significant increases in the steady-state Cmax and AUC of carbamazepine (23% and 23%, respectively), while the steady-state Cmax and the AUC of the carbamazepine metabolite, 10,11 epoxycarbamazepine, decreased by 21% and 20%, respectively. The coadministration of the two drugs significantly reduced the steady-state Cmax and AUC of nefazodone by 86% and 93%, respectively. Similar reductions in the Cmax and AUC of HO-NEF were also observed (85% and 94%), while the reductions in Cmax and AUC of mCPP and triazole-dione were more modest (13% and 44% for the former and 28% and 57% for the latter). Due to the potential for coadministration of carbamazepine to result in insufficient plasma nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone concentrations for achieving an antidepressant effect for nefazodone, it is recommended that nefazodone not be used in combination with carbamazepine (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
).
General Anesthetics – Little is known about the potential for interaction between nefazodone and general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, nefazodone hydrochloride should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.
Other CNS-Active Drugs – The use of nefazodone in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if concomitant administration of nefazodone and such drugs is required.









Cimetidine


When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and cimetidine (300 mg QID) were coadministered for one week, no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or cimetidine was observed compared to each dosed alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.









Theophylline


When nefazodone (200 mg BID) was given to patients being treated with theophylline (600 to 1200 mg/day) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there was no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or theophylline. FEV1 measurements taken when theophylline and nefazodone were coadministered did not differ from baseline dosage (i.e., when theophylline was administered alone). Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.









Cardiovascular-Active Drugs


Digoxin – When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and digoxin (0.2 mg QD) were coadministered for 9 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18) who were phenotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of digoxin were increased by 29%, 27%, and 15%, respectively. Digoxin had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its active metabolites. Because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin, caution should be exercised when nefazodone and digoxin are coadministered; plasma level monitoring for digoxin is recommended.
Propranolol – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) and propranolol (40 mg BID) for 5.5 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18), including 3 poor and 15 extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, resulted in 30% and 14% reductions in Cmax and AUC of propranolol, respectively, and a 14% reduction in Cmax for the metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol. The kinetics of nefazodone, hydroxynefazodone, and triazole-dione were not affected by coadministration of propranolol. However, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of m-chlorophenylpiperazine were increased by 23%, 54%, and 28%, respectively. No change in initial dose of either drug is necessary and dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors – When single 40 mg doses of simvastatin or atorvastatin, both substrates of CYP3A4, were given to healthy adult volunteers who had received nefazodone hydrochloride, 200 mg BID for 6 days, approximately 20 fold increases in plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and 3 to 4 fold increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone were seen. These effects appear to be due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by nefazodone because, in the same study, nefazodone had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of pravastatin, which is not metabolized by CYP3A4 to a clinically significant extent.
There have been rare reports of rhabdomyolysis involving patients receiving the combination of nefazodone and either simvastatin or lovastatin, also a substrate of CYP3A4 (see 



ADVERSE REACTIONS


, 


Postintroduction Clinical Experience



). Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administered alone (at recommended dosages) and in particular, for certain drugs in this class, when given in combination with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isozyme.
Caution should be used if nefazodone is administered in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin, and dosage adjustments of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are recommended. Since metabolic interactions are unlikely between nefazodone and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo little or no metabolism by the CYP3A4 isozyme, such as pravastatin or fluvastatin, dosage adjustments should not be necessary.









Immunosuppressive Agents


There have been reports of increased blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus into toxic ranges when patients received these drugs concomitantly with nefazodone. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus are substrates of CYP3A4, and nefazodone is known to inhibit this enzyme. If either cyclosporine or tacrolimus is administered with nefazodone, blood concentrations of the immunosuppressive agent should be monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly.









Pharmacokinetics of Nefazodone in ‘Poor Metabolizers’ and Potential Interaction with Drugs That Inhibit and/or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes


CYP3A4 Isozyme – Nefazodone has been shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4. This is consistent with the interactions observed between nefazodone and triazolam, alprazolam, buspirone, atorvastatin, and simvastatin, drugs metabolized by this isozyme. Consequently, caution is indicated in the combined use of nefazodone with any drugs known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. In particular, the combined use of nefazodone with triazolam should be avoided for most patients, including the elderly. The combined use of nefazodone with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, or pimozide is contraindicated (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
).
CYP2D6 Isozyme – A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. Such individuals are referred to commonly as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the tricyclic antidepressants. The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its major metabolites are not altered in these “poor metabolizers.” Plasma concentrations of one minor metabolite (mCPP) are increased in this population; the adjustment of nefazodone dosage is not required when administered to “poor metabolizers.” Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro to be extremely weak inhibitors of CYP2D6. Thus, it is not likely that nefazodone will decrease the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by this isozyme.
CYP1A2 Isozyme – Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP1A2. Thus, metabolic interactions between nefazodone and drugs metabolized by this isozyme are unlikely.

7.1 Effect of DIACOMIT on Other Drugs


CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates

In vitro data show that stiripentol is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Because of potential drug-drug interactions, consider dose adjustment of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine), CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., sertraline, thiotepa), and CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam, triazolam, quinidine), as clinically appropriate, when administered concomitantly with DIACOMIT.
Because of potential inhibition of enzyme/transporter activity, consider a reduction in dosage of substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam, clopidogrel), P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine), and BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, prazosin, glyburide), if adverse reactions are experienced when administered concomitantly with DIACOMIT.

Clobazam
Co-administration of DIACOMIT (which inhibits CYP 3A4 and 2C19) with clobazam results in increased plasma concentrations of clobazam (a substrate of CYP3A4) and norclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam (a substrate of CYP2C19) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may increase the risk of clobazam-related adverse reactions. Consider a reduction in dosage of clobazam if adverse reactions are experienced when co-administered with DIACOMIT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].









7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on DIACOMIT

Induction-based interactions leading to decreases in DIACOMIT concentrations are possible when co-administered with a potent CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or CYP2C19 inducer, such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, as these enzymes all metabolize stiripentol. Concomitant use of strong inducers with DIACOMIT should be avoided, or dosage adjustments should be made.

REYVOW may further lower heart rate when administered with heart rate lowering drugs. (7.3)








7.1 CNS Depressants

Concomitant administration of REYVOW and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of REYVOW to cause sedation, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, REYVOW should be used with caution if used in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].








7.2 Serotonergic Drugs

Concomitant administration of REYVOW and drugs (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, trazodone, etc.), over-the counter medications (e.g., dextromethorphan), or herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's Wort) that increase serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Use REYVOW with caution in patients taking medications that increase serotonin.








7.3 Heart Rate Lowering Drugs

REYVOW has been associated with a lowering of heart rate [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. In a drug interaction study, addition of a single 200 mg dose of REYVOW to propranolol decreased heart rate by an additional 5 beats per minute compared to propranolol alone, for a mean maximum of 19 beats per minute. Use REYVOW with caution in patients taking concomitant medications that lower heart rate if this magnitude of heart rate decrease may pose a concern.








7.4 P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Transporter Substrates

Coadministration of REYVOW with P-gp substrates where a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities (e.g., digoxin) is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","alcohol, SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAO inhibitors, trazodone, dextromethorphan, St. John's Wort, propranolol, digoxin"

In psoriasis studies the safety of STELARA® in combination with immunosuppressive agents or phototherapy has not been evaluated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. In psoriatic arthritis studies, concomitant MTX use did not appear to influence the safety or efficacy of STELARA®. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis induction studies, immunomodulators (6-MP, AZA, MTX) were used concomitantly in approximately 30% of subjects and corticosteroids were used concomitantly in approximately 40% and 50% of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis subjects, respectively. Use of these concomitant therapies did not appear to influence the overall safety or efficacy of STELARA®.








7.2 	CYP450 Substrates

The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Thus, STELARA®, an antagonist of IL-12 and IL-23, could normalize the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation of STELARA® in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring for therapeutic effect (e.g., for warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., for cyclosporine) should be considered and the individual dose of the drug adjusted as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 	Allergen Immunotherapy

STELARA® has not been evaluated in patients who have undergone allergy immunotherapy. STELARA® may decrease the protective effect of allergen immunotherapy (decrease tolerance) which may increase the risk of an allergic reaction to a dose of allergen immunotherapy.

[see Dosage and Administration (2), Contraindications (4)
 and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. Coadministration of EDURANT and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of EDURANT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Coadministration of EDURANT with drugs that increase gastric pH may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs.
EDURANT at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.
Table 5 shows the established and other potentially significant drug interactions based on which alterations in dose or regimen of EDURANT and/or coadministered drug may be recommended. Drugs that are not recommended for coadministration with EDURANT are also included in Table 5.

7.1  P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib by 60%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) with OFEV may increase exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of OFEV. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with OFEV [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, decreased exposure to nintedanib by 50%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort) with OFEV should be avoided as these drugs may decrease exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

ILOPERIDONE tablets, for oral use
Initial U.S. Approval: 2009",DI,"7. DRUG INTERACTIONS





									 The dose of iloperidone tablets should be reduced in patients co-administered a strong CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitor. (2.2, 7.1)
								 








Given the primary CNS effects of iloperidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Due to its -alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonism, iloperidone has the potential to enhance the effect of certain antihypertensive agents. 







7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Iloperidone

Iloperidone is not a substrate for CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP2E1 enzymes. This suggests that an interaction of iloperidone with inhibitors or inducers of these enzymes, or other factors, like smoking, is unlikely. 
Both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for iloperidone metabolism. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) or CYP2D6 (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine) can inhibit iloperidone elimination and cause increased blood levels. 


Ketoconazole: 
Co-administration of ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily for 4 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with a 3 mg single dose of iloperidone to 19 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 45 years, increased the area under the curve (AUC) of iloperidone and its metabolites P88 and P95 by 57%, 55% and 35%, respectively. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by about one-half when administered with ketoconazole or other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole). Weaker inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, grapefruit juice) have not been studied. When the CYP3A4 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. 


Fluoxetine
: Co-administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice daily for 21 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, with a single 3 mg dose of iloperidone to 23 healthy volunteers, ages 29 to 44 years, who were classified as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, increased the AUC of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 2 to 3 fold, and decreased the AUC of its metabolite P95 by one-half. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by one-half when administered with fluoxetine. When fluoxetine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 would be expected to have similar effects and would need appropriate dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, iloperidone dose could then be increased to the previous level. 


Paroxetine: 
Co-administration of paroxetine (20 mg/day for 5 to 8 days), a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, with multiple doses of iloperidone (8 or 12 mg twice daily) to patients with schizophrenia ages 18 to 65 years resulted in increased mean steady-state peak concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88, by about 1.6 fold, and decreased mean steady-state peak concentrations of its metabolite P95 by one-half. Iloperidone doses should be reduced by one-half when administered with paroxetine. When paroxetine is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the iloperidone dose should be returned to the previous level. Other strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 would be expected to have similar effects and would need appropriate dose reductions. When the CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, iloperidone dose could then be increased to previous levels. 


Paroxetine and Ketoconazole: 
Co-administration of paroxetine (20 mg once daily for 10 days), a CYP2D6 inhibitor, and ketoconazole (200 mg twice daily) with multiple doses of iloperidone (8 or 12 mg twice daily) to patients with schizophrenia ages 18 to 65 years resulted in a 1.4 fold increase in steady-state concentrations of iloperidone and its metabolite P88 and a 1.4 fold decrease in the P95 in the presence of paroxetine. So giving iloperidone with inhibitors of both of its metabolic pathways did not add to the effect of either inhibitor given alone. Iloperidone doses should therefore be reduced by about one-half if administered concomitantly with both a CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitor. 







7.2 Potential for Iloperidone to Affect Other Drugs


In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that iloperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by the following cytochrome P450 isozymes: CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, or CYP2E1. Furthermore, in vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that iloperidone does not have enzyme inducing properties, specifically for the following cytochrome P450 isozymes: CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. 


Dextromethorphan: 
A study in healthy volunteers showed that changes in the pharmacokinetics of dextromethorphan (80 mg dose) when a 3 mg dose of iloperidone was co-administered resulted in a 17% increase in total exposure and a 26% increase in the maximum plasma concentrations Cmax of dextromethorphan. Thus, an interaction between iloperidone and other CYP2D6 substrates is unlikely. 


Fluoxetine: 
A single 3 mg dose of iloperidone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluoxetine (20 mg twice daily). 


Midazolam (a sensitive CYP 3A4 substrate): 
 A study in patients with schizophrenia showed a less than 50% increase in midazolam total exposure at iloperidone steady state (14 days of oral dosing at up to 10 mg iloperidone twice daily) and no effect on midazolam Cmax. Thus, an interaction between iloperidone and other CYP3A4 substrates is unlikely. 







7.3 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval

Iloperidone should not be used with any other drugs that prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","CYP2D6, CYP3A4, ketoconazole, fluoxetine, paroxetine, itraconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, dextromethorphan, midazolam"

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Pretomanid    


CYP3A4 Inducers 

Co-administration of pretomanid with rifampin and efavirenz resulted in a decrease in pretomanid plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Avoid co-administration of the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid with rifampin, efavirenz, or other strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers.  Refer to the prescribing information for bedaquiline for additional information about drug interactions with CYP3A4.

Lopinavir/ritonavir 

Co-administration of pretomanid with lopinavir/ritonavir did not affect the plasma concentrations of pretomanid [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Lopinavir/ritonavir can be co-administered with the combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid.   








7.2 Effect of Pretomanid on Other Drugs  


Midazolam 

Co-administration of pretomanid with the CYP3A4 substrate, midazolam, resulted in no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam or its major metabolite, 1-hydroxy-midazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  The combination regimen of Pretomanid Tablets, bedaquiline, and linezolid can be administered with CYP3A4 substrate drugs. 

Organic Anion Transporter-3 (OAT3), BCRP, OATP1B3 and P-gp Substrates

The effect of co-administration of pretomanid on the pharmacokinetics of OAT3 substrates in humans is unknown.  However, in vitro studies indicate that pretomanid significantly inhibits the OAT3 drug transporter [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could result in increased concentrations of OAT3 substrate drugs clinically and may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with these drugs. 
If pretomanid is co-administered with OAT3 substrate drugs (e.g., methotrexate, indomethacin, ciprofloxacin), increase monitoring for OAT3 substrate drug-related adverse reactions and consider dosage reduction for OAT3 substrate drugs, if needed.  Refer to the prescribing information of the co-administered drug for dosage reduction information.

In vitro studies cannot exclude the possibility that  pretomanid is an inhibitor of BCRP, OATP1B3 and P-gp [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  No clinical studies have been performed to investigate these interactions. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that co-administration of pretomanid with sensitive OATP1B3 substrates (e.g., valsartan, statins), BCRP substrates (e.g., rosuvastatin, prazosin, glyburide, sulfasalazine) and P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, verapamil) may increase their exposure.  If pretomanid is co-administered with substrates of OATP1B3, BCRP, or P-gp, increased monitoring for drug-related adverse reactions to the co-administered medicinal product should be performed.","rifampin, efavirenz, bedaquiline, linezolid, lopinavir, ritonavir, midazolam, methotrexate, indomethacin, ciprofloxacin, valsartan, statins, rosuvastatin, prazosin, glyburide, sulfasalazine, digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, verapamil"

7.1	Concomitant Drugs for Treatment of Adult Indications

In RA patients, population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate (MTX), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids on tocilizumab clearance. Concomitant administration of a single intravenous dose of 10 mg/kg ACTEMRA with 10-25 mg MTX once weekly had no clinically significant effect on MTX exposure. ACTEMRA has not been studied in combination with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
In GCA patients, no effect of concomitant corticosteroid on tocilizumab exposure was observed.








7.2	Interactions with CYP450 Substrates

Cytochrome P450s in the liver are down-regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as IL-6.  Inhibition of IL-6 signaling in RA patients treated with tocilizumab may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels than those in the absence of tocilizumab leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates.  In vitro studies showed that tocilizumab has the potential to affect expression of multiple CYP enzymes including CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.  Its effect on CYP2C8 or transporters is unknown.  In vivo studies with omeprazole, metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, and simvastatin, metabolized by CYP3A4, showed up to a 28% and 57% decrease in exposure one week following a single dose of ACTEMRA, respectively.  The effect of tocilizumab on CYP enzymes may be clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of ACTEMRA, in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) and the individual dose of the medicinal product adjusted as needed. Exercise caution when coadministering ACTEMRA with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of tocilizumab on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with WAKIX


Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with WAKIX





Effect of Other Drugs on WAKIX




Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors




Clinical Implication:

Concomitant administration of WAKIX with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increases pitolisant exposure by 2.2-fold. 



Prevention or Management:

Reduce the dose of WAKIX by half [see see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].



Strong CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Implication:

Concomitant use of WAKIX with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreases exposure of pitolisant by 50%.



Prevention or Management:

Assess for loss of efficacy after initiation of a strong CYP3A4 inducer. For patients stable on WAKIX 8.9 mg or 17.8 mg once daily, increase the dose of WAKIX to reach double the original daily dose (i.e., 17.8 mg or 35.6 mg, respectively) over 7 days. If concomitant dosing of a strong CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, decrease WAKIX dosage by half [see see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].



Histamine-1 (H1) Receptor Antagonists




Clinical Implication:

WAKIX increases the levels of histamine in the brain; therefore, H1 receptor antagonists that cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the effectiveness of WAKIX.



Prevention or Management:

Avoid centrally acting H1 receptor antagonists.



QT Interval Prolongation




Clinical Implication:

Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of WAKIX and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. 



Prevention or Management:

Avoid the use of WAKIX in combination with other drugs known to prolong the QT interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].



Effect of WAKIX on Other Drugs




Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates




Clinical Implication:

WAKIX is a borderline/weak inducer of CYP3A4. Therefore, reduced effectiveness of sensitive CYP3A4 substrates may occur when used concomitantly with WAKIX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) may be reduced when used with WAKIX and effectiveness may be reduced for 21 days after discontinuation of therapy.



Prevention or Management:

Patients using hormonal contraception should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method during treatment with WAKIX and for at least 21 days after discontinuation of treatment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].












7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with WAKIX

An increased risk of serious infections has been seen in clinical studies of other TNF-blocking agents used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit. Formal drug interaction studies have not been performed with rituximab or natalizumab. Because of the nature of the adverse events seen with these combinations with TNF blocker therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the use of CIMZIA in these combinations. There is not enough information to assess the safety and efficacy of such combination therapy. Therefore, the use of CIMZIA in combination with anakinra, abatacept, rituximab, or natalizumab is not recommended

Nitrates: Co-administration of Adempas with nitrates or nitric oxide donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form is contraindicated because of hypotension [see Contraindications (4.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

PDE Inhibitors: Co-administration of Adempas with specific PDE-5 inhibitors (such as sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil) and nonspecific PDE inhibitors (such as dipyridamole or theophylline), is contraindicated because of hypotension. Do not administer within 24 hours of sildenafil. Do not administer 24 hours before or within 48 hours after tadalafil [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Clinical experience with co-administration of Adempas and other phosphodiesterase inhibitors (for example, milrinone, cilostazole, roflumilast) is limited.








7.2 Pharmacokinetic Interactions with Adempas 


Smoking: Plasma concentrations in smokers are reduced by 50% to 60% compared to nonsmokers. Based on pharmacokinetic modeling, for patients who are smokers, doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day may be considered in order to match exposure seen in nonsmoking patients. Safety and effectiveness of Adempas doses higher than 2.5 mg three times a day have not been established. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who stop smoking [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors: Concomitant use of riociguat with strong cytochrome CYP inhibitors and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole antimycotics (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole) or HIV protease inhibitors (such as ritonavir) increase riociguat exposure and may result in hypotension. Consider a starting dose of 0.5 mg 3 times a day when initiating Adempas in patients receiving strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypotension on initiation and on treatment with strong CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors. A dose reduction should be considered in patients who may not tolerate the hypotensive effect of riociguat [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Strong CYP3A inducers: Strong inducers of CYP3A (for example, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or St. John’s Wort) may significantly reduce riociguat exposure. Data are not available to guide dosing of riociguat when strong CYP3A inducers are co-administered. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Injection, USP",DI,"Drug Interactions

The simultaneous oral or intravenous administration of phenytoin and antineoplastic chemotherapy combinations that included vincristine sulfate has been reported to reduce blood levels of the anticonvulsant and to increase seizure activity. Dosage adjustment should be based on serial blood level monitoring. The contribution of vincristine sulfate to this interaction is not certain. The interaction may result from reduced absorption of phenytoin and an increase in the rate of its metabolism and elimination.
Vincristine sulfate is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A isozymes (CYP3A). Concurrent administration of vincristine sulfate with itraconazole or fluconazole (known inhibitors of the CYP3A metabolic pathway) has been reported to cause an earlier onset and/or an increased severity of neuromuscular side effects (see 
ADVERSE REACTIONS
). This interaction is presumed to be related to inhibition of the metabolism of vincristine. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with vincristine sulfate should be avoided. Patients should be frequently monitored for adverse reactions with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) with vincristine sulfate.
Concurrent use of strong CYP3A inducers (e.g., St. John's Wort) with vincristine sulfate should be avoided.

7.1	Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Sofosbuvir is a substrate of drug transporter P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) while the predominant circulating metabolite GS-331007 is not. Drugs that are P-gp inducers in the intestine (e.g., rifampin or St. John's wort) may decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentration, leading to reduced therapeutic effect of SOVALDI, and thus concomitant use with SOVALDI is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Clearance of HCV infection with direct acting antivirals may lead to changes in hepatic function, which may impact the safe and effective use of concomitant medications. For example, altered blood glucose control resulting in serious symptomatic hypoglycemia has been reported in diabetic patients in postmarketing case reports and published epidemiological studies. Management of hypoglycemia in these cases required either discontinuation or dose modification of concomitant medications used for diabetes treatment.
Frequent monitoring of relevant laboratory parameters (e.g. International Normalized Ratio [INR] in patients taking warfarin, blood glucose levels in diabetic patients) or drug concentrations of concomitant medications such as cytochrome P450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g. certain immunosuppressants) is recommended to ensure safe and effective use. Dose adjustments of concomitant medications may be necessary.

Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine with 400 mg of ketoconazole once daily for 10 days in 8 healthy volunteers resulted in an increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 64% and 79%, respectively, and an increase in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 322 hours to 448 hours. Ketoconazole should not be administered with mefloquine or within 15 weeks of the last dose of mefloquine due to the risk of a potentially fatal prolongation of the QTc interval (see 
WARNINGS
).









Other Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval


Coadministration of other drugs known to alter cardiac conduction (e.g., anti-arrhythmic or beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, antihistamines or H1-blocking agents, tricyclic antidepressants and phenothiazines) might also contribute to a prolongation of the QTc interval. There are no data that conclusively establish whether the concomitant administration of mefloquine and the above listed agents has an effect on cardiac function.









Anticonvulsants


In patients taking an anticonvulsant (e.g., valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin), the concomitant use of mefloquine may reduce seizure control by lowering the plasma levels of the anticonvulsant. Therefore, patients concurrently taking anti-seizure medication and mefloquine should have the blood level of their anti-seizure medication monitored and the dosage adjusted appropriately (see 
PRECAUTIONS
).









Vaccines


When mefloquine is taken concurrently with oral live typhoid vaccines, attenuation of immunization cannot be excluded. Vaccinations with attenuated live bacteria should therefore be completed at least 3 days before the first dose of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets.









Rifampin (Potent Inducer of CYP3A4)


Coadministration of a single 500 mg oral dose of mefloquine and 600 mg of rifampin once daily for 7 days in 7 healthy Thai volunteers resulted in a decrease in the mean Cmax and AUC of mefloquine by 19% and 68%, respectively, and a decrease in the mean elimination half-life of mefloquine from 305 hours to 113 hours. Rifampin should be used cautiously in patients taking mefloquine.









Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP3A4


Mefloquine does not inhibit or induce the CYP 450 enzyme system. Thus, concomitant administration of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets and substrates of the CYP 450 enzyme system is not expected to result in a drug interaction. However, mefloquine is metabolized by CYP3A4 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to an increase in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential risk of adverse reactions. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inhibitors. Similarly, inducers of CYP3A4 may modify the pharmacokinetics/metabolism of mefloquine, leading to a decrease in mefloquine plasma concentrations and potential reduction in efficacy of mefloquine hydrochloride tablets. Therefore, mefloquine hydrochloride tablets should also be used with caution when administered concomitantly with CYP3A4 inducers.









Substrates and Inhibitors of P-glycoprotein


It has been shown in vitro that mefloquine is a substrate and an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. Therefore, drug-drug interactions could also occur with drugs that are substrates or are known to modify the expression of this transporter. The clinical relevance of these interactions is not known to date.









Other Potential Interactions


No other drug interactions are known. Nevertheless, the effects of mefloquine on travelers receiving concomitant medications, particularly diabetics or patients using anticoagulants, should be checked before departure.
In clinical trials, the concomitant administration of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine did not alter the adverse reaction profile of mefloquine.","propranolol,halofantrine,quinine,quinidine,chloroquine,ketoconazole,valproic acid,carbamazepine,phenobarbital,phenytoin,rifampin,sulfadoxine,pyrimethamine"

7.1 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions







Coagulation tests

TAKHZYRO can increase activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) due to an interaction of TAKHZYRO with the aPTT assay. The reagents used in the aPTT laboratory test initiate intrinsic coagulation through the activation of plasma kallikrein in the contact system. Inhibition of plasma kallikrein by TAKHZYRO can increase aPTT in this assay. In Trial 1, prolongation of aPTT (>1× ULN) was observed at one or more time points in 3, 9, and 11 patients treated with TAKHZYRO 150 mg q4wks, 300 mg q4wks, and 300 mg q2wks, respectively, compared to 5 placebo-treated patients. Only one patient in the 300 mg q2wks treatment group experienced transient aPTT prolongation ≥1.5x ULN which was confounded by ongoing heparin therapy. None of the increases in aPTT in patients treated with TAKHZYRO were associated with abnormal bleeding adverse events. There were no differences in INR values between treatment groups.",""

Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to effects of gastrointestinal motility (7.3)







7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors

The systemic exposure of darifenacin from darifenacin extended-release tablets is increased in the presence of CYP3A4 inhibitors. The daily dose of darifenacin should not exceed 7.5 mg when co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, clarithromycin and nefazadone). No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (for example, erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem and verapamil) [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 









7.2 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors (for example, paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine and duloxetine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.3 CYP2D6 Substrates

Caution should be taken when darifenacin is used concomitantly with medications that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 and which have a narrow therapeutic window (for example, flecainide, thioridazine and tricyclic antidepressants) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 









7.4 CYP3A4 Substrates

Darifenacin (30 mg daily) did not have a significant impact on midazolam (7.5 mg) pharmacokinetics [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 









7.5 Combination oral contraceptives

Darifenacin (10 mg three times daily) had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of the combination oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 









7.6 Warfarin

Darifenacin had no significant effect on prothrombin time when a single dose of warfarin 30 mg was co-administered with darifenacin (30 mg daily) at steady-state. Standard therapeutic prothrombin time monitoring for warfarin should be continued.








7.7 Digoxin

Darifenacin (30 mg daily) did not have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin (0.25 mg) at steady-state. Routine therapeutic drug monitoring for digoxin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Diuretics


Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of perindopril erbumine therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either decreasing the dose of or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretic therapy cannot be altered, provide close medical supervision with the first dose of perindopril erbumine, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition.








7.2 Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics


Perindopril erbumine may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient’s serum potassium frequently.








7.3 Lithium


Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. Frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity.








7.4 Gold


Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE Inhibitor therapy including perindopril erbumine.








7.5 Digoxin


A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with perindopril erbumine, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded.








7.6 Gentamicin


Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies.








7.7 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)


In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may result in deterioration of renal function,  including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving perindopril and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including perindopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.








7.8 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on perindopril erbumine and other agents that affect the RAS.

Do not co-administer aliskiren with perindopril erbumine in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with perindopril erbumine in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).

7.1 Insulin

The pharmacokinetic parameters of pramlintide are altered when SYMLIN is mixed in the same syringe with regular, NPH, and 70/30 premixed formulations of recombinant human insulin. SYMLIN and insulin must not be mixed and must be administered as separate injections [see
 Dosage and Administration (2.4)

7.2 Oral Medications

SYMLIN has the potential to delay the absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. When the rapid onset or threshold concentration of a concomitant orally administered medication is a critical determinant of effectiveness (such as with analgesics, antibiotics, and oral contraceptives), the medication should be administered at least 1 hour prior to SYMLIN injection or 2 hours after SYMLIN injection [see
 Warnings and Precautions (5.5)

7.3 Drugs Affecting Gastrointestinal Motility

Due to its effects on gastric emptying, SYMLIN should not be considered for patients taking medications that alter gastrointestinal motility (e.g., anticholinergic agents such as atropine) or medications that slow the intestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., alpha-glucosidase inhibitors). Patients using these medications have not been studied in SYMLIN clinical trials [see

Initial U.S. Approval: 1985",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.
Benzodiazepines, including Quazepam Tablets, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g. psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of Quazepam Tablets and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects.

Initial U.S. Approval: 1996",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

The following study results were obtained using zileuton immediate-release tablets but the conclusions also apply to zileuton extended-release tablets.






Zileuton      increases theophylline levels. Reduce theophylline dose and monitor      levels. (7.1)
Zileuton      increases warfarin levels.  Monitor prothrombin time and adjust warfarin      dose accordingly. (7.2)
Zileuton      increases propranolol levels and beta-blocker activity.  Monitor      appropriately. (7.3)







7.1 Theophylline

In a drug-interaction study in 16 healthy subjects, coadministration of multiple doses of zileuton immediate-release tablets (800 mg every 12 hours) and theophylline (200 mg every 6 hours) for 5 days resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 50%) in steady-state clearance of theophylline, an approximate doubling of theophylline AUC, and an increase in theophylline C
         
 
  max (by 73%). The elimination half-life of theophylline was increased by 24%. Also, during coadministration, theophylline-related adverse reactions were observed more frequently than after theophylline alone. Upon initiation of zileuton extended-release tablets in patients receiving theophylline, the theophylline dosage should be reduced by approximately one-half and plasma theophylline concentrations monitored. Similarly, when initiating therapy with theophylline in a patient receiving zileuton extended-release tablets, the maintenance dose and/or dosing interval of theophylline should be adjusted accordingly and guided by serum theophylline determinations.
        

 







7.2 Warfarin

Concomitant administration of multiple doses of zileuton immediate-release tablets (600 mg every 6 hours) and warfarin (fixed daily dose obtained by titration in each subject) to 30 healthy male subjects resulted in a 15% decrease in R-warfarin clearance and an increase in AUC of 22%. The pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin were not affected. These pharmacokinetic changes were accompanied by a clinically significant increase in prothrombin times. Monitoring of prothrombin time, or other suitable coagulation tests, with the appropriate dose titration of warfarin is recommended in patients receiving concomitant zileuton extended-release tablets and warfarin therapy.







7.3 Propranolol

Coadministration of zileuton immediate-release tablets and propranolol results in a significant increase in propranolol concentrations. Administration of a single 80 mg dose of propranolol in 16 healthy male subjects who received zileuton immediate-release tablets 600 mg every 6 hours for 5 days resulted in a 42% decrease in propranolol clearance. This resulted in an increase in propranolol C
         
 
  max, AUC, and elimination half-life by 52%, 104%, and 25%, respectively. There was an increase in β-blockade as shown by a decrease in heart rate associated with the coadministration of these drugs. Patients concomitantly on zileuton extended-release tablets and propranolol should be closely monitored and the dose of propranolol reduced as necessary. No formal drug-drug interaction studies between zileuton and other beta-adrenergic blocking agents (i.e., β-blockers) have been conducted. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with zileuton extended-release tablets.
        

 







7.4 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy

Drug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy subjects between zileuton immediate-release tablets and prednisone and ethinyl estradiol (oral contraceptive), drugs known to be metabolized by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme, have shown no significant interaction. However, no formal drug-drug interaction studies between zileuton and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketaconazole, have been conducted. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with zileuton extended-release tablets. 
Drug-drug interaction studies in healthy subjects have been conducted with zileuton immediate-release tablets and digoxin, phenytoin, sulfasalazine, and naproxen.

Closely monitor when DAYBUE is used in combination with orally administered CYP3A4 sensitive substrates for which a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities. 
Plasma concentrations of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates may be increased if given concomitantly with DAYBUE [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid the concomitant use of DAYBUE with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrates for which a small change in substrate plasma concentration may lead to serious toxicities.",""""""

Inhibitors of Bile Acid Transporters

Avoid concomitant use of inhibitors of the bile salt efflux pump (BSEP) such as cyclosporine. Concomitant medications that inhibit canalicular membrane bile acid transporters such as the BSEP may exacerbate accumulation of conjugated bile salts in the liver and result in clinical symptoms. If concomitant use is deemed necessary, monitoring of serum transaminases and bilirubin is recommended.










Bile Acid Binding Resins

Bile acid binding resins such as cholestyramine, colestipol, or colesevelam adsorb and reduce bile acid absorption and may reduce the efficacy of CHOLBAM. Take CHOLBAM at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours (or at as great an interval as possible) after a bile acid binding resin [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

•Use caution if other drugs which have sedative and hypnotic properties, slow cardiac conduction and/or cause peripheral neuropathy must be used. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)

•It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID. (5.15, 7.4)

•Patients taking concomitant therapies such as erythropoietin stimulating agents or estrogen containing therapies may have an increased risk of thromboembolism. (7.7)








7.1   Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, or Other CNS Depressants (Including Alcohol)

The use of opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety agents, or other CNS depressants concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive sedative effect and should be avoided.








7.2   Drugs which Cause Bradycardia

The use of drugs which slow cardiac conduction concomitantly with THALOMID may cause an additive bradycardic effect and should be used with caution. Cardiovascular medications which may cause bradycardia include calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, alpha/beta-adrenergic blockers, and digoxin. Non-cardiac drugs that may cause bradycardia include H2 blockers (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine), lithium, tricyclic antidepressants and neuromuscular blockers (succinylcholine).
In 16 healthy men, the pharmacokinetic profile of a single 0.5 mg digoxin dose was similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day at steady state levels. The single dose of digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of THALOMID. The safety of long-term concomitant use of THALOMID and digoxin has not been evaluated.








7.3   Drugs which Cause Peripheral Neuropathy

The use of drugs which cause peripheral neuropathy (e.g., bortezomib, amiodarone, cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, disulfiram, phenytoin, metronidazole, alcohol) can cause an additive effect and should be used with caution.








7.4   Hormonal Contraceptives

Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of thromboembolism. It is not known whether concomitant use of hormonal contraceptives further increases the risk of thromboembolism with THALOMID.
In 10 healthy women, the pharmacokinetic profiles of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol following administration of a single dose containing 1.0 mg of norethindrone acetate and 75 mcg of ethinyl estradiol were studied. The results were similar with and without coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day to steady-state levels.








7.5   Warfarin

In 13 healthy men, the pharmacokinetic profile and international normalized ratio (INR) of prothrombin time for warfarin, following a single oral dose of 25 mg, were similar with and without the coadministration of THALOMID 200 mg/day at steady-state levels. The single dose of warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetic profile of thalidomide.








7.6   Drugs that Interfere with Hormonal Contraceptives

Concomitant use of HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or certain herbal supplements such as St. John's Wort with hormonal contraceptive agents may reduce the effectiveness of the contraception up to one month after discontinuation of these concomitant therapies. Therefore, females requiring treatment with one or more of these drugs must use two OTHER effective or highly effective methods of contraception while taking THALOMID.








7.7   Concomitant Therapies that may Increase the Risk of Thromboembolism

Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thromboembolism, such as estrogen containing therapies, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving THALOMID with dexamethasone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","Opioids, Antihistamines, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety Agents, Alcohol, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, alpha/beta-adrenergic blockers, digoxin, famotidine, cimetidine, lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, neuromuscular blockers, succinylcholine, bortezomib, amiodarone, cisplatin, docetaxel, paclitaxel, vincristine, disulfiram, phenytoin, metronidazole, norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol, warfarin, HIV-protease inhibitors, griseofulvin, modafinil, penicillins, rifampin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, St. John's Wort, erythropoietic agents, estrogen containing therapies"

Population pharmacokinetic analyses did not detect any effect of methotrexate (MTX) on sarilumab clearance. KEVZARA has not been investigated in combination with JAK inhibitors or biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].








7.2 Interactions with CYP450 Substrates 

Various in vitro and limited in vivo human studies have shown that cytokines and cytokine modulators can influence the expression and activity of specific cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and therefore have the potential to alter the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are substrates of these enzymes. Elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentration may down-regulate CYP activity such as in patients with RA and hence increase drug levels compared to subjects without RA. Blockade of IL-6 signaling by IL-6Rα antagonists such as KEVZARA might reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-6 and restore CYP activity, leading to altered drug concentrations.
The modulation of IL-6 effect on CYP enzymes by KEVZARA may be clinically relevant for CYP substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted. Upon initiation or discontinuation of KEVZARA, in patients being treated with CYP substrate medicinal products, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., theophylline) and adjust the individual dose of the medicinal product as needed.
Exercise caution when co-administering KEVZARA with CYP3A4 substrate drugs where decrease in effectiveness is undesirable, e.g., oral contraceptives, lovastatin, atorvastatin, etc. The effect of KEVZARA on CYP450 enzyme activity may persist for several weeks after stopping therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.


1.
Anticoagulants — Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.

2.
Corticosteroids — Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.

3.
Griseofulvin — Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.

4.
Doxycycline — Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued. This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If amobarbital sodium and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.

5.
Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid — The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to increase the amobarbital sodium serum levels; therefore, amobarbital sodium blood levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.

6.
CNS Depressants — The concomitant use of other CNS depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.

7.
Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) — MAOIs prolong the effects of barbiturates, probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.

8.
Estradiol, Estrone, Progesterone, and Other Steroidal Hormones — Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) who become pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking barbiturates.","dicumarol, warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, griseofulvin, doxycycline, phenytoin, sodium valproate, valproic acid, antihistamines, tranquilizers, alcohol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, estradiol, estrone, progesterone"

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on XOSPATA



Combined P-gp and Strong CYP3A Inducers 


Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducer decreases gilteritinib exposure which may decrease XOSPATA efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of XOSPATA with combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inducers.


Strong CYP3A Inhibitors


Concomitant use of XOSPATA with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increases gilteritinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider alternative therapies that are not strong CYP3A inhibitors. If the concomitant use of these inhibitors is considered essential for the care of the patient, monitor patient more frequently for XOSPATA adverse reactions. Interrupt and reduce XOSPATA dosage in patients with serious or life-threatening toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].








7.2 Effect of XOSPATA on Other Drugs 



Drugs that Target 5HT2B Receptor or Sigma Nonspecific Receptor


Concomitant use of gilteritinib may reduce the effects of drugs that target the 5HT2B receptor or the sigma nonspecific receptor (e.g., escitalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline). Avoid concomitant use of these drugs with XOSPATA unless their use is considered essential for the care of the patient [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


P-gp, BCRP, and OCT1 Substrates


Based on in vitro data, gilteritinib is a P-gp, breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP), and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) inhibitor. Coadministration of gilteritinib may increase the exposure of P-gp, BCRP, and OCT1 substrates, which may increase the incidence and severity of adverse reactions of these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1	TNF-Blocking Agent and IL-1 Blocking Agent

Specific drug interaction studies have not been conducted with ARCALYST. Concomitant administration of another drug that blocks IL-1 with a TNF-blocking agent in another patient population has been associated with an increased risk of serious infections and an increased risk of neutropenia. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with TNF-blocking agents may also result in similar toxicities and is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The concomitant administration of ARCALYST with other drugs that block IL-1 has not been studied. Based upon the potential for pharmacologic interactions between rilonacept and a recombinant IL-1ra, concomitant administration of ARCALYST and other agents that block IL-1 or its receptors is not recommended.








7.2	Cytochrome P450 Substrates

The formation of CYP450 enzymes is suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-1) during chronic inflammation. Thus it is expected that for a molecule that binds to IL-1, such as rilonacept, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. This is clinically relevant for CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, where the dose is individually adjusted (e.g., warfarin). Upon initiation of ARCALYST in patients being treated with these types of medicinal products, therapeutic monitoring of the effect or drug concentration should be performed, and the individual dose of the medicinal product may need to be adjusted.","TNF-blocking agents, recombinant IL-1ra, warfarin"

Table 4. Clinically Important Drug Interactions with SOGROYA 








Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment 






Clinical Impact:



Microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. GH inhibits 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of SOGROYA may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. 





Intervention:



Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SOGROYA [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.7

)].






Examples:



Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.





Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs






Clinical Impact:



Limited published data indicate that GH treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. SOGROYA may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes.





Intervention:



Careful monitoring is advisable when SOGROYA is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes.





Oral Estrogen






Clinical Impact:



Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to SOGROYA. 





Intervention:



Patients receiving oral estrogen replacement may require higher SOGROYA dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].





Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents






Clinical Impact:



Treatment with SOGROYA may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses. 





Intervention:



Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

7.2	Digoxin

NATPARA causes transient increase in calcium and therefore, concomitant use of NATPARA and cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) may predispose patients to digitalis toxicity if hypercalcemia develops. Digoxin efficacy is reduced if hypocalcemia is present. In patients using NATPARA concomitantly with digoxin, carefully monitor serum calcium and digoxin levels, and patients for signs and symptoms of digoxin toxicity.

7.1	Adrenergic Drugs

If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)
].








7.2	Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics

Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of STRIVERDI RESPIMAT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)
].








7.3	Non-Potassium Sparing Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics.








7.4	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs

STRIVERDI RESPIMAT, as with other beta2-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants or other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the action of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents.  Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval may be associated with an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.








7.5	Beta-Blockers

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and STRIVERDI RESPIMAT may interfere with the effect of each other when administered concurrently.  Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients.  Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers.  However, under certain circumstances, e.g. as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD.  In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

Dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors

Coadministration of INREBIC with a dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitor increases fedratinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased exposure may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Due to potential increase of exposure, patients taking concomitant dual CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inhibitors require more intensive safety monitoring and, if necessary, dose modifications of INREBIC based on adverse reactions [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].










7.2 	Effect of INREBIC on Other Drugs







CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 Substrate Drugs

Coadministration of INREBIC with drugs that are CYP3A4 substrates, CYP2C19 substrates, or CYP2D6 substrates increases the concentrations of these drugs, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor for adverse reactions and adjust the dose of drugs that are CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 substrates as necessary when coadministered with INREBIC.

OCT2 and MATE1/2-K Substrate Drugs

Coadministration of INREBIC with drugs that are renally excreted via organic cation transporter (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE)1/2-K can decrease renal clearance of those drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions


Tables 3 and 4 lists drug classes and individual products, respectively, with a potential for interaction with tranylcypromine sulfate, describes the predominant observed or anticipated risks, and provides advice on concomitant use.  Given serious adverse reactions with multiple agents, patients should avoid taking over-the-counter medications or dietary supplements without prior consultation with a healthcare provider able to provide advice on the potential for interactions. 

Time to Start Tranylcypromine Sulfate after Discontinuation of a Contraindicated Drug

 For products that are contraindicated with tranylcypromine sulfate, a time period of 4 to 5 half-lives of the other product or any active metabolite should elapse before starting treatment with tranylcypromine sulfate.   After stopping treatment with an MAO inhibitor antidepressant, a time period of at least 1 week or 4 to 5 half-lives of the other MAO inhibitor (whichever is longer) should elapse before starting treatment with tranylcypromine sulfate because of the risk for clinically significant adverse reactions after discontinuation due to persistent MAO inhibition [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].  This period can be several weeks long (e.g., a minimum of 5 weeks for fluoxetine given fluoxetine's long half-life). Refer to the prescribing information of the contraindicated product for relevant information.

Time to Start Contraindicated Drug after Discontinuation of Tranylcypromine Sulfate

The potential for interactions persists after discontinuation of tranylcypromine sulfate until MAO activity has sufficiently recovered.  Inhibition of MAO may persist up to 10 days following discontinuation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)].  After stopping tranylcypromine sulfate, at least 1 week should elapse before starting another MAOI (intended to treat MDD) or other contraindicated antidepressants. Refer to the prescribing information of any agent considered for subsequent use for recommendations on the duration of a waiting period after discontinuation of a MAO inhibitor.  
If in the absence of therapeutic alternatives and emergency treatment with a contraindicated drug (e.g., linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, direct-acting sympathomimetic drugs such as epinephrine) becomes necessary and cannot be delayed, discontinue tranylcypromine sulfate as soon as possible before initiating treatment with the other agent, and monitor closely for adverse reactions.

7.2 Tyramine-Containing Foods and Beverages

Tranylcypromine Sulfate inhibits intestinal MAO, which is responsible for the catabolism of tyramine in food and beverages. As a result of this inhibition, large amounts of tyramine may enter the systemic circulation and precipitate a sudden elevation in blood pressure or hypertensive crisis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Instruct tranylcypromine sulfate-treated patients to avoid foods and beverages with significant tyramine content during treatment with tranylcypromine sulfate or within 2 weeks of stopping treatment (see Table 5 for a list of food and beverages containing significant amounts of tyramine).

Drug interaction studies in humans have not been conducted with VISUDYNE.
Verteporfin is rapidly eliminated by the liver, mainly as unchanged drug. Metabolism is limited and occurs by liver and plasma esterases. Microsomal cytochrome P450 does not appear to play a role in verteporfin metabolism.
Based on the mechanism of action of verteporfin, many drugs used concomitantly could influence the effect of VISUDYNE therapy. Possible examples include the following:
Calcium channel blockers, polymyxin B or radiation therapy could enhance the rate of VISUDYNE uptake by the vascular endothelium. Other photosensitizing agents (e.g., tetracyclines, sulfonamides, phenothiazines, sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents, thiazide diuretics and griseofulvin) could increase the potential for skin photosensitivity reactions. Compounds that quench active oxygen species or scavenge radicals, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, β-carotene, ethanol, formate and mannitol, would be expected to decrease VISUDYNE activity. Drugs that decrease clotting, vasoconstriction or platelet aggregation, e.g., thromboxane A2 inhibitors, could also decrease the efficacy of VISUDYNE therapy.","Calcium channel blockers,polymyxin B,tetracyclines,sulfonamides,phenothiazines,sulfonylurea hypoglycemic agents,thiazide diuretics,griseofulvin,dimethyl sulfoxide,β-carotene,ethanol,formate,mannitol,thromboxane A2 inhibitors"

Reversible decreases in steady-state plasma digoxin concentrations and renal glycoside excretion were observed in patients receiving beta-acetyldigoxin and chemotherapy regimens containing cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone with or without cytarabine injection or procarbazine.


Steady-state plasma digitoxin concentrations did not appear to change. Therefore, monitoring of plasma digoxin levels may be indicated in patients receiving similar combination chemotherapy regimens. The utilization of digitoxin for such patients may be considered as an alternative.

An in vitro interaction study between gentamicin and cytarabine showed a cytarabine related antagonism for the susceptibility of K. pneumoniae strains. This study suggests that in patients on cytarabine being treated with gentamicin for a K. pneumoniae infection, the lack of a prompt therapeutic response may indicate the need for re-evaluation of antibacterial therapy.

Clinical evidence in one patient showed possible inhibition of fluorocytosine efficacy during therapy with cytarabine injection.

Coadministration of oral ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily increased retapamulin geometric mean AUC(0-24) and Cmax by 81% after topical application of retapamulin ointment, 1% on the abraded skin of healthy adult males. Due to low systemic exposure to retapamulin following topical application in adults and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older, dosage adjustments for retapamulin are unnecessary in these patients when coadministered with CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole. Based on in vitro P450 inhibition studies and the low systemic exposure observed following topical application of ALTABAX, retapamulin is unlikely to affect the metabolism of other P450 substrates.
Concomitant administration of retapamulin and CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, has not been studied in pediatric patients. In pediatric subjects aged 2 to 24 months, systemic exposure of retapamulin was higher compared with subjects aged 2 years and older after topical application [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)].

Although not specifically identified in studies with tinidazole, the following drug interactions were reported for metronidazole, a chemically-related nitroimidazole. Therefore, these drug interactions may occur with tinidazole.





The following drug interactions were reported for metronidazole, a chemically-related nitroimidazole and may therefore occur with tinidazole:

Warfarin and other oral coumarin anticoagulants: Anticoagulant dosage may need adjustment during and up to 8 days after tinidazole therapy (7.1)
Alcohol-containing beverages/preparations: Avoid during and up to 3 days after tinidazole therapy (7.1)
Lithium: Monitor serum lithium concentrations (7.1)
Cyclosporine, tacrolimus: Monitor for toxicities of these immunosuppressive drugs (7.1)
Fluorouracil: Monitor for fluorouracil-associated toxicities (7.1)
Phenytoin, fosphenytoin: Adjustment of anticonvulsant and/or tinidazole dose(s) may be needed (7.1,
7.2)
CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors: Monitor for decreased tinidazole effect or increased adverse reactions (7.2)








7.1 Potential Effects of Tinidazole on Other Drugs


Warfarin and Other Oral Coumarin Anticoagulants: As with metronidazole, tinidazole may enhance the effect of warfarin and other coumarin anticoagulants, resulting in a prolongation of prothrombin time. The dosage of oral anticoagulants may need to be adjusted during tinidazole co-administration and up to 8 days after discontinuation.

Alcohols, Disulfiram: Alcoholic beverages and preparations containing ethanol or propylene glycol should be avoided during tinidazole therapy and for 3 days afterward because abdominal cramps, nausea, vomiting, headaches, and flushing may occur. Psychotic reactions have been reported in alcoholic patients using metronidazole and disulfiram concurrently. Though no similar reactions have been reported with tinidazole, tinidazole should not be given to patients who have taken disulfiram within the last two weeks.

Lithium: Metronidazole has been reported to elevate serum lithium levels. It is not known if tinidazole shares this property with metronidazole, but consideration should be given to measuring serum lithium and creatinine levels after several days of simultaneous lithium and tinidazole treatment to detect potential lithium intoxication.

Phenytoin, Fosphenytoin: Concomitant administration of oral metronidazole and intravenous phenytoin was reported to result in prolongation of the half-life and reduction in the clearance of phenytoin. Metronidazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of orally-administered phenytoin.

Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus: There are several case reports suggesting that metronidazole has the potential to increase the levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. During tinidazole co-administration with either of these drugs, the patient should be monitored for signs of calcineurin-inhibitor associated toxicities

Fluorouracil: Metronidazole was shown to decrease the clearance of fluorouracil, resulting in an increase in side-effects without an increase in therapeutic benefits. If the concomitant use of tinidazole and fluorouracil cannot be avoided, the patient should be monitored for fluorouracil-associated toxicities.








7.2 Potential Effects of Other Drugs on Tinidazole


CYP3A4 Inducers and Inhibitors: Simultaneous administration of tinidazole with drugs that induce liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inducers such as phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin, and  fosphenytoin  (a pro-drug of phenytoin), may accelerate the elimination of tinidazole, decreasing the plasma level of tinidazole. Simultaneous administration of drugs that inhibit the activity of liver microsomal enzymes, i.e., CYP3A4 inhibitors such as  cimetidine and ketoconazole, may prolong the half-life and decrease the plasma clearance of tinidazole, increasing the plasma concentrations of tinidazole.

Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine was shown to decrease the oral bioavailability of metronidazole by 21%. Thus, it is advisable to separate dosing of cholestyramine and tinidazole to minimize any potential effect on the oral bioavailability of tinidazole.

Oxytetracycline: Oxytetracycline was reported to antagonize the therapeutic effect of metronidazole.








7.3 Laboratory Test Interaction

Tinidazole, like metronidazole, may interfere with certain types of determinations of serum chemistry values, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), triglycerides, and hexokinase glucose. Values of zero may be observed. All of the assays in which interference has been reported involve enzymatic coupling of the assay to oxidation-reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +↔ NADH). Potential interference is due to the similarity of absorbance peaks of NADH and tinidazole.
Tinidazole, like metronidazole, may produce transient leukopenia and neutropenia; however, no persistent hematological abnormalities attributable to tinidazole have been observed in clinical studies. Total and differential leukocyte counts are recommended if re-treatment is necessary.","Warfarin, other oral coumarin anticoagulants, Alcohol-containing beverages/preparations, Lithium, Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, Fluorouracil, Phenytoin, fosphenytoin, CYP3A4 inducers/inhibitors, Alcohols, Disulfiram, phenobarbital, rifampin, cimetidine, ketoconazole, Cholestyramine, Oxytetracycline"

Anticoagulants:

Anabolic steroids may increase sensitivity to oral anticoagulants. Dosage of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired prothrombin time. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when anabolic steroids are started or stopped.








Warfarin:

A multidose study of oxandrolone, given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin, resulted in a mean increase in S-warfarin half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng•hr/mL; similar increases in R-warfarin half-life and AUC were also detected. Microscopic hematuria (9/15) and gingival bleeding (1/15) were also observed. A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. 
Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding.








Oral Hypoglycemic Agents:

Oxandrolone may inhibit the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic agents.

In patients with edema, concomitant administration with adrenal cortical steroids or ACTH may increase the edema.","Warfarin, Oral Hypoglycemic Agents, Adrenal Steroids, ACTH"

Bile acid sequestering agents, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, may interfere with the action of chenodiol by reducing its absorption. Aluminum-based antacids have been showen to absorb bile acids in vitro and may be expected to interfere with chenodiol in the same manner as the sequestering agents. Estrogen, oral contraceptive and clofibrate (and perhaps other lipid-lowering drugs) increase biliary cholesterol secretion, and the incidence of cholesterol gallstones hence may counteract the effectiveness of chenodiol. 
Due to its hepatotoxicity, chenodiol can affect the pharmacodynamics of coumarin and its derivatives, causing unexpected prolongation of the prothrombin time and hemorrhages. Patients on concomitant therapy with chenodiol and coumarin or its derivatives should be monitored carefully. If prolongation of prothrombin time is observed, the coumarin dosage should be readjusted to give a prothrombin time 1½ to 2 times normal. If necessary Chenodal (chenodiol tablets) should be discontinued.","cholestyramine, colestipol, Aluminum-based antacids, Estrogen, oral contraceptive, clofibrate, coumarin"

ACE Inhibitors: 
Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE Inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE Inhibitors. 





Aspirin:
 As with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of tolmetin sodium and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.




Diuretics:
 Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.


Lithium:
 NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.




Methotrexate:
 NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.




Warfarin:
 The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.


The in vitro binding of warfarin to human plasma proteins is unaffected by tolmetin, and tolmetin does not alter the prothrombin time of normal volunteers. However, increased prothrombin time and bleeding have been reported in patients on concomitant tolmetin and warfarin therapy. Therefore, caution should be exercised when administering tolmetin to patients on anticoagulants.


Hypoglycemic Agents:
 In adult diabetic patients under treatment with either sulfonylureas or insulin there is no change in the clinical effects of either tolmetin or the hypoglycemic agents.","ACE Inhibitors,Aspirin,Diuretics,furosemide,thiazides,Lithium,Methotrexate,Warfarin,sulfonylureas,insulin"

•Avoid using cardiotoxic agents in combination with ELLENCE (7.1).

•Discontinue cimetidine during treatment with ELLENCE (7.2).








7.1	Cardiotoxic Agents

Closely monitor cardiac function when ELLENCE is used in combination with other cardiotoxic agents. Patients receiving ELLENCE after stopping treatment with other cardiotoxic agents, especially those with long half-lives such as trastuzumab, may be at an increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Trastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months. Therefore, avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab when possible. Monitor the patient's cardiac function closely if anthracyclines are used before this time. 
Concomitant use of ELLENCE with other cardioactive compounds that could cause heart failure (e.g., calcium channel blockers), requires close monitoring of cardiac function throughout treatment.








7.2	Cimetidine

Cimetidine increases the exposure to epirubicin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Discontinue cimetidine during treatment with ELLENCE.








7.3	Other Cytotoxic Drugs

ELLENCE used in combination with other cytotoxic drugs may show on-treatment additive toxicity, especially hematologic and gastrointestinal effects.








Paclitaxel:

The administration of epirubicin immediately prior to or after paclitaxel increased the systemic exposure of epirubicin, epirubicinol and 7-deoxydoxorubicin aglycone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











Docetaxel:

The administration of epirubicin immediately prior to or after docetaxel did not have an effect on the systemic exposure of epirubicin, but increased the systemic exposure of epirubicinol and 7-deoxydoxorubicin aglycone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











7.4	Radiation Therapy

There are few data regarding the coadministration of radiation therapy and ELLENCE. In adjuvant trials of ELLENCE-containing CEF-120 or FEC-100 chemotherapies, breast irradiation was delayed until after chemotherapy was completed. This practice resulted in no apparent increase in local breast cancer recurrence relative to published accounts in the literature. A small number of patients received ELLENCE-based chemotherapy concomitantly with radiation therapy but had chemotherapy interrupted in order to avoid potential overlapping toxicities. It is likely that use of ELLENCE with radiotherapy may sensitize tissues to the cytotoxic actions of irradiation. Administration of ELLENCE after previous radiation therapy may induce an inflammatory recall reaction at the site of the irradiation.","trastuzumab, calcium channel blockers, cimetidine, paclitaxel, docetaxel"

A screening drug-drug interaction study indicated that ORBACTIV is a nonspecific, weak inhibitor (CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) or inducer (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) of several CYP isoforms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. A drug-drug interaction study that assessed the interaction potential of a single 1,200 mg dose of ORBACTIV on the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (CYP2C9 probe substrate) showed no effect of ORBACTIV on S-warfarin Cmax or AUC.
Avoid administering ORBACTIV concomitantly with drugs that are predominantly metabolized by one of the affected CYP450 enzymes, as co-administration may increase or decrease concentrations of those drugs. Patients should be closely monitored for signs of toxicity or lack of efficacy if they have been given ORBACTIV while on a potentially affected compound (e.g. patients should be monitored for bleeding if concomitantly receiving ORBACTIV and warfarin).








7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions







Prolongation of Certain Laboratory Coagulation Tests

ORBACTIV may artificially prolong certain laboratory coagulation tests (see Table 2) by binding to and preventing the action of the phospholipid reagents which activate coagulation in commonly used laboratory coagulation tests [see Contraindications (4.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.5)]. For patients who require monitoring of anticoagulation effect within the indicated time after ORBACTIV dosing, a non-phospholipid dependent coagulation test such as a Factor Xa (chromogenic) assay or an alternative anticoagulant not requiring aPTT monitoring may be considered.
ORBACTIV does not interfere with coagulation in vivo. In addition, ORBACTIV does not affect tests that are used for diagnosis of Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT).

	Prescribing Information",DI,"Drug Interactions


No dose adjustment is necessary when Simulect is added to triple-immunosuppression regimens, including cyclosporine, corticosteroids, and either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Three clinical trials have investigated Simulect use in combination with triple-therapy regimens. Pharmacokinetics were assessed in two of these trials. Total body clearance of Simulect was reduced by an average 22% and 51% when azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, respectively, were added to a regimen consisting of cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) and corticosteroids. Nonetheless, the range of individual Simulect clearance values in the presence of azathioprine (12-57 mL/h) or mycophenolate mofetil (7-54 mL/h) did not extend outside the range observed with dual therapy (10-78 mL/h). The following medications have been administered in clinical trials with Simulect with no increase in adverse reactions: ATG/ALG, azathioprine, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, and muromonab-CD3.







Carcinogenesis/Mutagenesis/Impairment of Fertility


No mutagenic potential of Simulect was observed in the i
n vitro assays with Salmonella (Ames) and V79 Chinese hamster cells. No long-term or fertility studies in laboratory animals have been performed to evaluate the potential of Simulect to produce carcinogenicity or fertility impairment, respectively.
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. No maternal toxicity, embryotoxicity, or teratogenicity was observed in cynomolgus monkeys 100 days post coitum following dosing with basiliximab during the organogenesis period; blood levels in pregnant monkeys were 13-fold higher than those seen in human patients. Immunotoxicology studies have not been performed in the offspring.  Because IgG molecules are known to cross the placental barrier, because the IL-2 receptor may play an important role in development of the immune system, and because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Simulect should only be used in pregnant women when the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception before beginning Simulect therapy, during therapy, and for 4 months after completion of Simulect therapy.









Nursing Mothers


It is not known whether Simulect is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs, including human antibodies are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reactions, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.









Pediatric Use


No randomized, placebo-controlled studies have been completed in pediatric patients. In a safety and pharmacokinetic study, 41 pediatric patients (1-11 years of age [n = 27], 12-16 years of age [n = 14], median age 8.1 years) were treated with Simulect via intravenous bolus injection in addition to standard immunosuppressive agents, including cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED), corticosteroids, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil. The acute rejection rate at 6 months was comparable to that in adults in the triple-therapy trials. The most frequently reported adverse events were hypertension, hypertrichosis, and rhinitis (49% each), urinary tract infections (46%), and fever (39%). Overall, the adverse event profile was consistent with general clinical experience in the pediatric renal transplantation population and with the profile in the controlled adult renal transplantation studies. The available pharmacokinetic data in children and adolescents are described in CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
It is not known whether the immune response to vaccines, infection, and other antigenic stimuli administered or encountered during Simulect therapy is impaired or whether such response will remain impaired after Simulect therapy.









Geriatric Use


Controlled clinical studies of Simulect have included a small number of patients 65 years and older (Simulect 28; placebo 32). From the available data comparing Simulect and placebo-treated patients, the adverse event profile in patients ≥ 65 years of age is not different from patients < 65 years of age and no age-related dosing adjustment is required. Caution must be used in giving immunosuppressive drugs to elderly patients.","azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, corticosteroids, ATG/ALG, muromonab-CD3"

7.1	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect PREVYMIS

Letermovir is a substrate of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1/3 (OATP1B1/3) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1/3 (UGT1A1/3) enzymes. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are inhibitors of OATP1B1/3 transporters may result in increases in letermovir plasma concentrations (Table 4).
Co-administration of PREVYMIS with inducers of transporters (e.g. P-gp) and/or enzymes (e.g. UGTs) is not recommended due to the potential for a decrease in letermovir plasma concentrations (see Table 4).








7.2	Potential for PREVYMIS to Affect Other Drugs

Co-administration of PREVYMIS with midazolam results in increased midazolam plasma concentrations, indicating that letermovir is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are CYP3A substrates may result in clinically relevant increases in the plasma concentrations of co-administered CYP3A substrates (Table 4) [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].
Letermovir is an inhibitor of OATP1B1/3 transporters. Co-administration of PREVYMIS with drugs that are substrates of OATP1B1/3 transporters may result in a clinically relevant increase in plasma concentrations of co-administered OATP1B1/3 substrates (Table 4).

Laboratory Test Interference

 At room temperature, Elitek causes enzymatic degradation of the uric acid in blood/plasma/serum samples potentially resulting in spuriously low plasma uric acid assay readings.  The following special sample handling procedure must be followed to avoid ex vivo uric acid degradation.
Uric acid must be analyzed in plasma.  Blood must be collected into prechilled tubes containing heparin anticoagulant.  Immediately immerse plasma samples for uric acid measurement in an ice water bath.  Plasma samples must be prepared by centrifugation in a precooled centrifuge (4°C).  Finally, the plasma must be maintained in an ice water bath and analyzed for uric acid within four hours of collection [see Boxed Warning].
Rasburicase does not metabolize allopurinol, cytarabine, methylprednisolone, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, thioguanine, etoposide, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide or vincristine in vitro.

Strong Inhibitors of CYP2D6




Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with strong CYP2D6 inhibitors increases plasma concentrations of vortioxetine.



Intervention

Reduce TRINTELLIX dose by half when a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is coadministered [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].



Examples

bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine



Strong CYP Inducers




Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with a strong CYP inducer decreases plasma concentrations of vortioxetine.



Intervention

Consider increasing the TRINTELLIX dose when a strong CYP inducer is coadministered. The maximum dose is not recommended to exceed three times the original dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].




Examples

rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin



Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelets agents and anticoagulants)



Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug may potentiate the risk of bleeding.



Intervention

Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of TRINTELLIX and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.2)].



Examples

aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin



Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein




Clinical Impact

TRINTELLIX is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of TRINTELLIX with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of TRINTELLIX or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma.




Intervention

Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of TRINTELLIX or other protein bound drugs as warranted [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].



Examples

Warfarin











7.2	Effect of TRINTELLIX on Other Drugs







Other CNS Active Agents

No clinically relevant effect was observed on steady-state lithium exposure following coadministration with multiple daily doses of TRINTELLIX. Multiple doses of TRINTELLIX did not affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (composite cognitive score) of diazepam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
A clinical study has shown that TRINTELLIX (single dose of 20 or 40 mg) did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol (single dose of 0.6 g/kg) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis

Following coadministration of stable doses of warfarin (1 to 10 mg/day) with multiple daily doses of TRINTELLIX, no significant effects were observed in INR, prothrombin values or total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics for both R- and S-warfarin. Coadministration of aspirin 150 mg/day with multiple daily doses of TRINTELLIX had no significant inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation or pharmacokinetics of aspirin and salicylic acid [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Patients receiving other drugs that interfere with hemostasis should be carefully monitored when TRINTELLIX is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.1)].










Highly Protein Bound Drugs

In a clinical study with coadministration of TRINTELLIX (10 mg/day) and warfarin (1 mg/day to 10 mg/day), a highly protein bound drug, no significant change in INR was observed [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










7.3	Interference with Urine Enzyme Immunoassays for Methadone

False positive results in urine enzyme immunoassays for methadone have been reported in patients who have taken vortioxetine. An alternative analytical technique (e.g., chromatographic methods) should be considered to confirm positive methadone urine drug screen results.","selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue, SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, St. John's Wort, bupropion, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin, diazepam, alcohol"

CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ritonavir) increased ribociclib exposure in healthy subjects by 3.2-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, grapefruit juice, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, and voriconazole) and consider alternative concomitant medications with less potential for CYP3A inhibition.
If coadministration of KISQALI with a strong CYP3A inhibitor cannot be avoided, reduce the dose of KISQALI to 400 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].
Instruct patients to avoid grapefruit or grapefruit juice, which are known to inhibit cytochrome CYP3A enzymes and may increase the exposure to ribociclib [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].








7.2     Drugs That May Decrease Ribociclib Plasma Concentrations
							


CYP3A4 Inducers

Coadministration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased the plasma exposure of ribociclib in healthy subjects by 89% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers and consider an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A (e.g., phenytoin, rifampin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s wort [Hypericum perforatum]).








7.3     Effect of KISQALI on Other Drugs


CYP3A Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Index

Coadministration of midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate) with multiple doses of KISQALI (400 mg) increased the midazolam exposure by 3.8-fold in healthy subjects, compared with administration of midazolam alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. KISQALI given at the clinically relevant dose of 600 mg is predicted to increase the midazolam AUC by 5.2-fold. Therefore, caution is recommended when KISQALI is administered with CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index. The dose of a sensitive CYP3A substrate with a narrow therapeutic index, including but not limited to alfentanil, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, everolimus, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, may need to be reduced as ribociclib can increase their exposure.

7.1	Effect of Other Drugs on LORBRENA







Strong CYP3A Inducers

Concomitant use of LORBRENA with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased lorlatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease the efficacy of LORBRENA.
Severe hepatotoxicity occurred in healthy subjects receiving LORBRENA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer. In 12 healthy subjects receiving a single 100 mg dose of LORBRENA with multiple daily doses of rifampin, Grade 3 or 4 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 83% of subjects and Grade 2 increases in ALT or AST occurred in 8%. A possible mechanism for hepatotoxicity is through activation of the pregnane X receptor (PXR) by LORBRENA and rifampin, which are both PXR agonists.
LORBRENA is contraindicated in patients taking strong CYP3A inducers [see Contraindication (4)]. Discontinue strong CYP3A inducers for 3 plasma half-lives of the strong CYP3A inducer prior to initiating LORBRENA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].










Moderate CYP3A Inducers

7.1       
Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with 
STENDRA



Nitrates

Administration of STENDRA to patients who are using any form of organic nitrate, is contraindicated. In a clinical pharmacology trial, STENDRA was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effect of nitrates. In a patient who has taken STENDRA, where nitrate administration is deemed medically necessary in a life-threatening situation, at least 12 hours should elapse after the last dose of STENDRA before nitrate administration is considered. In such circumstances, nitrates should only be administered under close medical supervision with appropriate hemodynamic monitoring [see 

Contraindications (4.1)

, 

Dosage and Administration (2.3)

, and 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)

].

Alpha-Blockers

Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. In some patients, concomitant use of these two drug classes can lower blood pressure significantly leading to symptomatic hypotension (e.g., dizziness, lightheadedness, fainting) [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.6)

, 

Dosage and Administration (2.3)

, and 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)

].


Antihypertensives

PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, are mild systemic vasodilators. A clinical pharmacology trial was conducted to assess the effect of STENDRA on the potentiation of the blood pressure-lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine and enalapril). Additional reductions in blood pressure of 3 to 5 mmHg occurred following co-administration of a single 200 mg dose of STENDRA with these agents compared with placebo [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.6)

 and 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)

].


Alcohol

Both alcohol and PDE5 inhibitors, including STENDRA, act as vasodilators. When vasodilators are taken in combination, blood pressure-lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., greater than 3 units) in combination with STENDRA can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache [see 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)

].









7.2       
Potential for Other Drugs to Affect 
STENDRA


STENDRA is a substrate of and predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. Studies have shown that drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 can increase avanafil exposure.

Strong 
CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Ketoconazole (400 mg daily), a selective and strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, increased STENDRA 50 mg single-dose systemic exposure (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) equal to 13-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and prolonged the half-life of avanafil to approximately 9 hours. Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazadone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atanazavir and telithromycin) would be expected to have similar effects. Do not use STENDRA in patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.2)

 and 

Dosage and Administration (2.3)

].

HIV Protease inhibitor — Ritonavir (600 mg twice daily), a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9, increased STENDRA 50 mg single-dose Cmax and AUC equal to approximately 2-fold and 13-fold, and prolonged the half-life of avanafil to approximately 9 hours in healthy volunteers. Do not use STENDRA in patients taking ritonavir.

Moderate CYP 3A4 Inhibitors

Erythromycin (500 mg twice daily) increased STENDRA 200 mg single-dose Cmax and AUC equal to approximately 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and prolonged the half-life of avanafil to approximately 8 hours in healthy volunteers. Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, amprenavir, aprepitant, diltiazem, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, and verapamil) would be expected to have similar effects. Consequently, the maximum recommended dose of STENDRA is 50 mg, not to exceed once every 24 hours for patients taking concomitant moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.2)

 and 

Drug Interactions (7.2)

].

Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice are likely to increase avanafil exposure. 

Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors

No in vivo drug-drug interaction studies with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors were conducted.

CYP3A4 Substrate

When administered with STENDRA 200 mg, amlodipine (5 mg daily) increased the Cmax and AUC of avanafil by approximately 22% and 70%, respectively. The half-life of STENDRA was prolonged to approximately 10 hrs. The Cmax and AUC of amlodipine decreased by approximately 9% and 4%, respectively [see

If phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers are taken concurrently with disopyramide phosphate, lower plasma levels of disopyramide may occur. Monitoring of disopyramide plasma levels is recommended in such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. Other antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol) have occasionally been used concurrently with disopyramide phosphate. Excessive widening of the QRS complex and/or prolongation of the Q-T interval may occur in these situations (see 
Warnings
). In healthy subjects, no significant drug-drug interaction was observed when disopyramide phosphate was coadministered with either propranolol or diazepam. Concomitant administration of disopyramide phosphate and quinidine resulted in slight increases in plasma disopyramide levels and slight decreases in plasma quinidine levels. Disopyramide phosphate does not increase serum digoxin levels.
Until data on possible interactions between verapamil and disopyramide phosphate are obtained, disopyramide should not be administered within 48 hours before or 24 hours after verapamil administration.
Although potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole) have not been studied clinically, in vitro studies have shown that erythromycin and oleandomycin inhibit the metabolism of disopyramide. Cases of life-threatening interactions have been reported for disopyramide when given with clarithromycin and erythromycin indicating that coadministration of disopyramide with inhibitors of cytochrome 3A4 could result in potentially fatal interaction.","phenytoin, quinidine, procainamide, lidocaine, propranolol, diazepam, digoxin, verapamil, ketoconazole, erythromycin, oleandomycin, clarithromycin"

7.1	Drugs that Lower Seizure Threshold

The concomitant use of FIRDAPSE and drugs that lower seizure threshold may lead to an increased risk of seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The decision to administer FIRDAPSE concomitantly with drugs that lower the seizure threshold should be carefully considered in light of the severity of the associated risks.

•Strong cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, ketoconazole): Use not recommended. May increase risk of cardiovascular effects. (7.1)

•Monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants: Use with extreme caution. May potentiate effect of salmeterol on vascular system. (7.2)

•Beta-blockers: Use with caution. May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm. (7.3)

•Diuretics: Use with caution. Electrocardiographic changes and/or hypokalemia associated with non–potassium-sparing diuretics may worsen with concomitant beta-agonists. (7.4)








7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4

Salmeterol is a substrate of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin) with SEREVENT DISKUS is not recommended because increased cardiovascular adverse effects may occur.
In a drug interaction trial in 20 healthy subjects, coadministration of inhaled salmeterol (50 mcg twice daily) and oral ketoconazole (400 mg once daily) for 7 days resulted in greater systemic exposure to salmeterol (AUC increased 16-fold and Cmax increased 1.4-fold). Three (3) subjects were withdrawn due to beta2-agonist side effects (2 with prolonged QTc and 1 with palpitations and sinus tachycardia). Although there was no statistical effect on the mean QTc, coadministration of salmeterol and ketoconazole was associated with more frequent increases in QTc duration compared with salmeterol and placebo administration.








7.2 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants

SEREVENT DISKUS should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of salmeterol on the vascular system may be potentiated by these agents.








7.3 Beta-adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents

Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as salmeterol, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma or COPD. Therefore, patients with asthma or COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.








7.4 Non–Potassium-Sparing Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non–potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of SEREVENT DISKUS with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.","ritonavir, ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, beta-blockers, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics"

7.1 Drugs that Decrease Renal Calcium Excretion

Drugs that decrease renal calcium excretion, e.g., thiazide diuretics, may increase the risk of hypercalcemia in patients receiving FARESTON.








7.2 Agents that Prolong QT

The administration of FARESTON with agents that have demonstrated QT prolongation as one of their pharmacodynamic effects should be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with FARESTON be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with FARESTON is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that prolongs QT should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval. Agents generally accepted to prolong QT interval include Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide) antiarrhythmics; certain antipsychotics (e.g., thioridazine, haloperidol); certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, amitriptyline); certain antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin); and certain anti-emetics (e.g., ondansetron, granisetron). In patients at increased risk, electrocardiograms (ECGs) should be obtained and patients monitored as clinically indicated [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].








7.3 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inducers on Toremifene

Strong CYP3A4 enzyme inducers, such as dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort, lower the steady-state concentration of toremifene in serum.








7.4 Effect of Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors on Toremifene

In a study of 18 healthy subjects, 80 mg toremifene once daily coadministered with 200 mg of ketoconazole twice daily increased the toremifene Cmax and AUC by 1.4- and 2.9-fold, respectively. N-demethyltoremifene Cmax and AUC were reduced by 56% and 20%, respectively.
The administration of FARESTON with agents that are strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole) increase the steady-state concentration in serum and should be avoided. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of toremifene and should be avoided. Should treatment with any of these agents be required, it is recommended that therapy with FARESTON be interrupted. If interruption of treatment with FARESTON is not possible, patients who require treatment with a drug that strongly inhibits CYP3A4 should be closely monitored for prolongation of the QT interval [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].








7.5 Effect of Toremifene on CYP3A4 Substrates

In a study of 20 healthy subjects, 2 mg midazolam once daily (days 6 and 18) coadministered with toremifene as a 480 mg loading dose followed by 80 mg once daily for 16 days. Following coadministration on days 6 and 18 relevant increases in midazolam and α-hydroxymidazolam Cmax and AUC were not observed. Following coadministration on day 18 midazolam and α-hydroxymidazolam Cmax and AUC were reduced by less than 20%.
Clinically relevant exposure changes in sensitive substrates due to inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 by toremifene appear unlikely.








7.6 Effect of Toremifene on CYP2C9 Substrates

In a study of 20 healthy subjects, 500 mg tolbutamide once daily (days 7 and 19) coadministered with toremifene as a 480 mg loading dose followed by 80 mg once daily for 16 days. Following coadministration on days 7 and 19 plasma tolbutamide Cmax and AUC were increased by less than 30%. A reduction of similar magnitude was observed for hydroxytolbutamide and carboxytolbutamide Cmax and AUC.
Toremifene is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C9. Concomitant use of CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such as warfarin or phenytoin with FARESTON should be done with caution and requires careful monitoring (e.g., substrate concentrations (if possible), appropriate laboratory markers, and signs and symptoms of increased exposure).","thiazide diuretics, quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, amiodarone, sotalol, ibutilide, dofetilide, thioridazine, haloperidol, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, erythromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, ondansetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit juice, warfarin, phenytoin"

Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (ketoconazole) increased istradefylline AUCinf by 2.5-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, the recommended maximum dosage of NOURIANZ in patients concomitantly using strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin) is 20 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].











Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Coadministration of NOURIANZ with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) decreased istradefylline Cmax and AUCinf by 45% and 81%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid use of NOURIANZ with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, St. John's wort) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

• VIRACEPT should be given with food one hour after or more than 2 hours before didanosine (7)








7.1	Potential for VIRACEPT to Affect Other Drugs

Nelfinavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, immunosuppressants and PDE5 inhibitors) may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs that could increase or prolong both its therapeutic and adverse effects. (see Tables 3 and 6).








7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VIRACEPT

Nelfinavir is metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2C19. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that induce CYP3A or CYP2C19, such as rifampin, may decrease nelfinavir plasma concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of VIRACEPT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A or CYP2C19 may increase nelfinavir plasma concentrations.

When taken with food, TIVICAY and supplements containing calcium or iron can be taken at the same time. (7.3)








7.1 Effect of Dolutegravir on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Agents

In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the renal organic cation transporters, OCT2 (IC50 = 1.93 microM) and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE) 1 (IC50 = 6.34 microM). In vivo, dolutegravir inhibits tubular secretion of creatinine by inhibiting OCT2 and potentially MATE1. Dolutegravir may increase plasma concentrations of drugs eliminated via OCT2 or MATE1 (dofetilide, dalfampridine, and metformin, Table 8) [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3)].
In vitro, dolutegravir inhibited the basolateral renal transporters, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1 (IC50 = 2.12 microM) and OAT3 (IC50 = 1.97 microM). However, in vivo, dolutegravir did not alter the plasma concentrations of tenofovir or para-amino hippurate, substrates of OAT1 and OAT3.
In vitro, dolutegravir did not inhibit (IC50 greater than 50 microM) the following: cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A, uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)1A1, UGT2B7, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export pump (BSEP), organic anion transporter polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, multidrug resistance protein (MRP)2, or MRP4. In vitro, dolutegravir did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A4. Based on these data and the results of drug interaction trials, dolutegravir is not expected to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs that are substrates of these enzymes or transporters.








7.2 Effect of Other Agents on the Pharmacokinetics of Dolutegravir

Dolutegravir is metabolized by UGT1A1 with some contribution from CYP3A. Dolutegravir is also a substrate of UGT1A3, UGT1A9, BCRP, and P-gp in vitro. Drugs that induce those enzymes and transporters may decrease dolutegravir plasma concentration and reduce the therapeutic effect of dolutegravir.
Coadministration of dolutegravir and other drugs that inhibit these enzymes may increase dolutegravir plasma concentration.
Etravirine significantly reduced plasma concentrations of dolutegravir, but the effect of etravirine was mitigated by coadministration of lopinavir/ritonavir or darunavir/ritonavir and is expected to be mitigated by atazanavir/ritonavir (Table 8) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
In vitro, dolutegravir was not a substrate of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3.








7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions


Table 8 provides clinical recommendations as a result of drug interactions with TIVICAY or TIVICAY PD. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy [see Dosage and Administration (2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on JOENJA







Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

JOENJA is a substrate of CYP3A4. Leniolisib exposure was increased 2-fold when co-administered with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Concomitant use of JOENJA with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers

Concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers may result in reduced leniolisib exposure and thus reduced leniolisib efficacy. Therefore, concomitant use of JOENJA with strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










7.2 Effect of JOENJA on Other Drugs







CYP1A2 Metabolized Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index

Leniolisib inhibits CYP1A2 in a time-dependent manner in vitro. Avoid concomitant use of JOENJA with drugs that are primarily metabolized by isoenzyme CYP1A2 and have a narrow therapeutic index [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.2	Oral Naltrexone

Coadministration of LUCEMYRA and oral naltrexone resulted in statistically significant differences in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of naltrexone. It is possible that oral naltrexone efficacy may be reduced if used concomitantly within 2 hours of LUCEMYRA. This interaction is not expected if naltrexone is administered by non-oral routes [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Coadministration of erlotinib with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor increased erlotinib exposure. Erlotinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2. Increased erlotinib exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Avoid coadministering erlotinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit or grapefruit juice) or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor (e.g., ciprofloxacin). Reduce the erlotinib dosage when coadministering with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor or a combined CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 inhibitor if coadministration is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

CYP3A4 Inducers

Pre-treatment with a CYP3A4 inducer prior to erlotinib decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increase the erlotinib dosage if coadministration with CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital and St. John's wort) is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

CYP1A2 Inducers and Cigarette Smoking

Cigarette smoking decreased erlotinib exposure. Avoid smoking tobacco (CYP1A2 inducer) and avoid concomitant use of erlotinib with moderate CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., teriflunomide, rifampin, or phenytoin). Increase the erlotinib dosage in patients that smoke tobacco or when coadministration with moderate CYP1A2 inducers is unavoidable [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Drugs That Increase Gastric pH

Coadministration of erlotinib with proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) and H2 receptor antagonists (e.g., ranitidine) decreased erlotinib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. For proton pump inhibitors, avoid concomitant use if possible. For H2 receptor antagonists and antacids, modify the dosing schedule [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. Increasing the dose of erlotinib when coadministered with gastric PH elevating agents is not likely to compensate for the loss of exposure.

A
n
ticoagulants

Interaction with coumarin-derived anticoagulants, including warfarin, leading to increased International Normalized Ratio (INR) and bleeding adverse reactions, which in some cases were fatal, have been reported in patients receiving erlotinib. Regularly monitor prothrombin time or INR in patients taking coumarin-derived anticoagulants. Dose modifications of erlotinib are not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Some drugs or herbal products that may decrease the effectiveness of HCs include efavirenz, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, and products containing St. John's wort. Interactions between HCs and other drugs may lead to breakthrough bleeding and/or contraceptive failure. Counsel women to use an alternative non-hormonal method of contraception or a back-up method when enzyme inducers are used with HCs, and to continue back-up non-hormonal contraception for 28 days after discontinuing the enzyme inducer to ensure contraceptive reliability.










Substances increasing the plasma concentrations of HCs:

Co-administration of certain HCs and strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, or ketoconazole may increase the serum concentrations of progestins, including etonogestrel.










Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors:

Significant changes (increase or decrease) in the plasma concentrations of progestin have been noted in cases of co-administration with HIV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir/ritonavir, (fos)amprenavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tipranavir/ritonavir] or increase [e.g., indinavir and atazanavir/ritonavir])/HCV protease inhibitors (decrease [e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir]) or with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (decrease [e.g., nevirapine, efavirenz] or increase [e.g., etravirine]). These changes may be clinically relevant in some cases.
Consult the prescribing information of anti-viral and anti-retroviral concomitant medications to identify potential interactions.










7.2	Effects of Hormonal Contraceptives on Other Drugs

Hormonal contraceptives may affect the metabolism of other drugs. Consequently, plasma concentrations may either increase (for example, cyclosporine) or decrease (for example, lamotrigine). Consult the labeling of all concurrently-used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with hormonal contraceptives or the potential for enzyme alterations.","efavirenz, phenytoin, barbiturates, carbamazepine, bosentan, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, rifampicin, topiramate, rifabutin, rufinamide, aprepitant, St. John's wort, itraconazole, voriconazole, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, ketoconazole, etonogestrel, nelfinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, amprenavir, lopinavir, tipranavir, indinavir, atazanavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, nevirapine, etravirine, cyclosporine, lamotrigine"

Table 3: Clinically Relevant Interactions with BYDUREON BCISE






Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin 





Clinical Impact


Exenatide promotes insulin release from pancreatic beta-cells in the presence of elevated glucose concentrations. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when exenatide is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylureas) or insulin [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].




Intervention


When initiating BYDUREON BCISE, consider reducing the dose of concomitantly administered insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.





Warfarin





Clinical Impact


BYDUREON BCISE has not been studied with warfarin. However, in a drug interaction study, BYETTA did not have a significant effect on INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There have been postmarketing reports for exenatide of increased INR with concomitant use of warfarin, sometimes associated with bleeding [see 

Adverse Reactions (6.2)

].




Intervention


In patients taking warfarin, the INR should be monitored more frequently after initiating BYDUREON BCISE. Once a stable INR has been documented, the INR can be monitored at the intervals recommended for patients taking warfarin.





Orally Administered Drugs (e.g., acetaminophen)





Clinical Impact


Exenatide slows gastric emptying. Therefore, BYDUREON BCISE has the potential to reduce the rate of absorption of orally administered drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Intervention


Use caution when administering oral medications with BYDUREON BCISE where a slower rate of oral absorption may be clinically meaningful.

7.4 QT Interval Prolonging Drugs

In a drug interaction study of bedaquiline and ketoconazole in adults, a greater effect on QTc was observed after repeated dosing with bedaquiline and ketoconazole in combination than after repeated dosing with the individual drugs. Additive or synergistic QT prolongation was observed when bedaquiline was co-administered with other drugs that prolong the QT interval.
In Study 3, mean increases in QTc were larger in the 17 adult patients who were taking clofazimine with bedaquiline at Week 24 (mean change from reference of 31.9 ms) than in patients who were not taking clofazimine with bedaquiline at Week 24 (mean change from baseline of 12.3 ms). Monitor ECGs if SIRTURO is co-administered to patients receiving other drugs that prolong the QTc interval, and discontinue SIRTURO if evidence of serious ventricular arrhythmia or QTcF interval greater than 500 ms.

7.2 Effect of BRAFTOVI on Other Drugs







Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates

BRAFTOVI is a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state. Concomitant use of BRAFTOVI may decrease the plasma concentrations of CYP3A4 substrates (including hormonal contraceptives), [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of these substrates. Avoid the coadministration of BRAFTOVI with CYP3A4 substrates for which a decrease in plasma concentration may lead to reduced efficacy of the substrate. If the coadministration cannot be avoided, see the CYP3A4 substrate product labeling for recommendations.

CYP3A inhibitors: Reduce KALYDECO dose in patients aged 6 months and older when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole). KALYDECO is not recommended in patients aged 1 month to less than 6 months when co-administered with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid food or drink containing grapefruit. (2.4, 7.1)







7.1     Inhibitors of CYP3A

Ivacaftor is a sensitive CYP3A substrate. Co-administration with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, significantly increased ivacaftor exposure [measured as area under the curve (AUC)] by 8.5-fold. Based on simulations of these results, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose is recommended for patients 6 months and older taking concomitant strong CYP3A inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, telithromycin, and clarithromycin. KALYDECO is not recommended for patients less than 6 months of age taking strong CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Co-administration with fluconazole, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A, increased ivacaftor exposure by 3-fold. Therefore, a reduction of the KALYDECO dose is recommended for patients 6 months and older taking concomitant moderate CYP3A inhibitors, such as fluconazole and erythromycin. KALYDECO is not recommended for patients less than 6 months of age taking moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Co-administration of KALYDECO with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, avoid food or drink containing grapefruit during treatment with KALYDECO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].








7.2     Inducers of CYP3A

Co-administration with rifampin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased ivacaftor exposure (AUC) by approximately 9-fold. Therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)
 and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].








7.3     Ciprofloxacin

Co-administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin had no effect on the exposure of ivacaftor. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of KALYDECO with ciprofloxacin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].

Potential for ivacaftor to affect other drugs









7.4	CYP2C9 Substrates

Ivacaftor may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) during co-administration of KALYDECO with warfarin is recommended. Other therapeutic products for which exposure may be increased by KALYDECO include glimepiride and glipizide; these therapeutic products should be used with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.5     CYP3A and/or P-gp Substrates

Ivacaftor and its M1 metabolite have the potential to inhibit CYP3A and P-gp. Co-administration with  oral midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A substrate, increased midazolam exposure 1.5-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of CYP3A by ivacaftor. Co-administration with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin exposure by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by ivacaftor. Administration of KALYDECO may increase systemic exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A and/or P-gp, which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Therefore, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when co-administering KALYDECO with sensitive CYP3A and/or P-gp substrates, such as digoxin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

•Coadministration of fosamprenavir with drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease amprenavir (active metabolite) concentrations leading to potential loss of virologic activity. (7, 12.3) 

•Coadministration with drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations. (7, 12.3) 

•Coadministration of fosamprenavir or fosamprenavir and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. (7)

•Coadministration of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may result in clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. (7)








7.1 Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers 

Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 metabolism and therefore should not be administered concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4. 
Amprenavir is metabolized by CYP3A4. Coadministration of fosamprenavir and drugs that induce CYP3A4, such as rifampin, may decrease amprenavir concentrations and reduce its therapeutic effect. Coadministration of fosamprenavir and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase amprenavir concentrations and increase the incidence of adverse effects. 
The potential for drug interactions with fosamprenavir changes when fosamprenavir is coadministered with the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir. The magnitude of CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions (effect on amprenavir or effect on coadministered drug) may change when fosamprenavir is coadministered with ritonavir. Because ritonavir is a CYP2D6 inhibitor, clinically significant interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 are possible when coadministered with fosamprenavir plus ritonavir. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6, as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase.
There are other agents that may result in serious and/or life-threatening drug interactions [see Contraindications (4)]. 








7.2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions 

If fosamprenavir is used in combination with ritonavir, see full prescribing information for ritonavir for additional information on drug interactions [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Table 6 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. Information in the table applies to fosamprenavir with or without ritonavir, unless otherwise indicated.

Amprenavir, the active metabolite of fosamprenavir, is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Amprenavir inhibits CYP3A4. Data also suggest that amprenavir induces CYP3A4. Caution should be used when coadministering medications that are substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of CYP3A4, or potentially toxic medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Amprenavir does not inhibit CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, or uridine glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT). Amprenavir is both a substrate for and inducer of P-glycoprotein. 
Drug interaction trials were performed with fosamprenavir and other drugs likely to be coadministered or drugs commonly used as probes for pharmacokinetic interactions. The effects of coadministration on AUC, Cmax, and Cmin values are summarized in Table 10 (effect of other drugs on amprenavir) and Table 12 (effect of fosamprenavir on other drugs). In addition, since fosamprenavir delivers comparable amprenavir plasma concentrations as AGENERASE, drug interaction data derived from trials with AGENERASE are provided in Tables 11 and 13. For information regarding clinical recommendations, [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Class I or III antiarrhythmics: Contraindicated. (4, 7.1)
Digoxin: Consider discontinuation or halve dose of digoxin before treatment and monitor digoxin levels. (7.1, 7.3)
Calcium channel blockers (CCB): Initiate CCB with low dose and increase after ECG verification of tolerability. (7.1, 7.2, 7.3)
Beta-blockers: May provoke excessive bradycardia. Initiate with low dose and increase after ECG verification of tolerability. (7.1, 7.3)
CYP3A inducers: Avoid concomitant use. (7.2)
Grapefruit juice: Avoid concomitant use. (7.2)
Statins: Avoid simvastatin doses greater than 10 mg daily. Follow label recommendations for concomitant use of other statins with a CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor like dronedarone. (7.3)
CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., sirolimus and tacrolimus): Monitor and adjust dosage of concomitant drug as needed when used with MULTAQ. (7.3)
Warfarin: Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin. (7.3)








7.1 Pharmacodynamic Interactions







Drugs Prolonging the QT Interval (Inducing Torsade de Pointes)

Coadministration of drugs prolonging the QT interval (such as certain phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, certain macrolide antibiotics, and Class I and III antiarrhythmics) is contraindicated because of the potential risk of torsade de pointes–type ventricular tachycardia [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Digoxin

In the ANDROMEDA (patients with recently decompensated heart failure) and PALLAS (patients with permanent AF) trials baseline use of digoxin was associated with an increased risk of arrhythmic or sudden death in dronedarone-treated patients compared to placebo. In patients not taking digoxin, no difference in risk of sudden death was observed in the dronedarone versus placebo groups [see Clinical Studies (14.3)].
Digoxin can potentiate the electrophysiologic effects of dronedarone (such as decreased AV-node conduction). Dronedarone increases exposure to digoxin [see Drug Interactions (7.3),  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity.











Calcium Channel Blockers

Calcium channel blockers with depressant effects on the sinus and AV nodes could potentiate dronedarone's effects on conduction.
Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Beta-Blockers

In clinical trials, bradycardia was more frequently observed when dronedarone was given in combination with beta-blockers.
Give a low dose of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










7.2 Effects of Other Drugs on Dronedarone







Ketoconazole and Other Potent CYP3A Inhibitors

Concomitant use of ketoconazole as well as other potent CYP3A inhibitors such as itraconazole, voriconazole, ritonavir, clarithromycin, and nefazodone is contraindicated because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Grapefruit Juice

Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking MULTAQ because exposure to dronedarone is significantly increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Rifampin and Other CYP3A Inducers

Avoid rifampin or other CYP3A inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort because they decrease exposure to dronedarone significantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Calcium Channel Blockers

Verapamil and diltiazem are moderate CYP3A inhibitors and increase dronedarone exposure.  Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










7.3 Effects of Dronedarone on Other Drugs







Simvastatin

Dronedarone increased simvastatin/simvastatin acid exposure. Avoid doses greater than 10 mg once daily of simvastatin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Other Statins

Because of multiple mechanisms of interaction with statins (CYPs and transporters), follow statin label recommendations for use with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone.










Calcium Channel Blockers

Dronedarone increased the exposure of calcium channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem or nifedipine). Give a low dose of calcium channel blockers initially and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Sirolimus, Tacrolimus, and Other CYP3A Substrates with Narrow Therapeutic Range

Dronedarone can increase plasma concentrations of tacrolimus, sirolimus, and other CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range when given orally. Monitor plasma concentrations and adjust dosage appropriately.










Beta-Blockers and Other CYP2D6 Substrates

Dronedarone increased the exposure of propranolol and metoprolol. Give low doses of beta-blockers initially, and increase only after ECG verification of good tolerability. Other CYP2D6 substrates, including other beta-blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may have increased exposure upon coadministration with dronedarone [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










P-glycoprotein Substrates








Digoxin
Dronedarone increased digoxin exposure by inhibiting the P-gp transporter. Consider discontinuing digoxin. If digoxin treatment is continued, halve the dose of digoxin, monitor serum levels closely, and observe for toxicity [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









Dabigatran
Dronedarone increases dabigatran plasma exposures by inhibiting the P-gp transporter [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 30–50 mL/min), reduce the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when concomitantly administered with dronedarone. In patients with severe renal impairment (CrCL 15–30 mL/min), concomitant use of dronedarone with dabigatran should be avoided. 












Warfarin

When coadministered with dronedarone exposure to S-warfarin was slightly higher than when warfarin was administered alone. There were no clinically significant increases in INR [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
More patients experienced clinically significant INR elevations (≥5) usually within 1 week after starting dronedarone versus placebo in patients taking oral anticoagulants in ATHENA. However, no excess risk of bleeding was observed in the dronedarone group.
Postmarketing cases of increased INR with or without bleeding events have been reported in warfarin-treated patients initiated on dronedarone. Monitor INR after initiating dronedarone in patients taking warfarin.","Digoxin,Calcium channel blockers,Beta-blockers,CYP3A inducers,Grapefruit juice,Statins,Sirolimus,Tacrolimus,Warfarin,Phenothiazines,Tricyclic antidepressants,Macrolide antibiotics,Class I antiarrhythmics,Class III antiarrhythmics,Verapamil,Diltiazem,Nifedipine,Simvastatin,Propranolol,Metoprolol,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,SSRIs,Phenobarbital,Carbamazepine,Phenytoin,St. John's wort,Itraconazole,Voriconazole,Ritonavir,Clarithromycin,Nefazodone,Rifampin,Ketoconazole,Dabigatran"

7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs

Co-administration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility.








7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin
 
  [see

Dosage and Administration (2.5)]
 
  .

 
In a study in adults, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C
 
  max) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [
 
  see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 
There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by co-administration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C
 
  maxand AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice).

 
The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors

7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers

No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by co-administration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C
 
  maxand AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed.

 








7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors

The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C
 
  maxand AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively.

 
No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors.








7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450


In vitrodata indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [
 
  see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].

 








7.6 Oral Contraceptives

In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [
 
  see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].

 








7.7 Warfarin

A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [
 
  see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

Effect of Rifabutin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs
 
Rifabutin induces CYP3A enzymes and therefore may reduce the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by those enzymes. This effect may reduce the efficacy of standard doses of such drugs, which include itraconazole, clarithromycin, and saquinavir.


Effect of Other Drugs on Rifabutin Pharmacokinetics
 
Some drugs that inhibit CYP3A may significantly increase the plasma concentration of rifabutin. Therefore, carefully monitor for rifabutin associated adverse events in those patients also receiving CYP3A inhibitors, which include fluconazole and clarithromycin. In some cases, the dosage of rifabutin may need to be reduced when it is coadministered with CYP3A inhibitors. 
Table 2 summarizes the results and magnitude of the pertinent drug interactions assessed with rifabutin. The clinical relevance of these interactions and subsequent dose modifications should be judged in light of the population studied, severity of the disease, patient's drug profile, and the likely impact on the risk/benefit ratio.

7.1  Effect of Other Drugs on EPIDIOLEX


Strong CYP3A4 or CYP2C19 Inducers

Coadministration with a strong CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 inducer (rifampin 600 mg once daily) decreased cannabidiol and 7-OH-CBD plasma concentrations by approximately 32% and 63%.  The impact of such changes on efficacy of EPIDIOLEX is not known [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Consider an increase in EPIDIOLEX dosage (based on clinical response and tolerability) up to 2-fold, when coadministered with a strong CYP3A4 and/or CYP2C19 inducer.








7.2  Effect of EPIDIOLEX on Other Drugs


UGT1A9, UGT2B7, CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 Substrates 

Cannabidiol is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Increases in exposure of sensitive CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., caffeine, theophylline, or tizanidine) may be observed when coadministered with cannabidiol.
In vitro data predict drug-drug interactions with CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., bupropion, efavirenz), uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 (UGT1A9) substrates (e.g., diflunisal, propofol, fenofibrate), and UGT2B7 substrates (e.g., gemfibrozil, lamotrigine, morphine, lorazepam) when coadministered with EPIDIOLEX.  Coadministration of EPIDIOLEX is also predicted to cause clinically significant interactions with CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 (e.g., phenytoin) substrates.  Because of potential inhibition of enzyme activity, consider a reduction in dosage of substrates of UGT1A9, UGT2B7, CYP1A2, CYP2C8, and CYP2C9, as clinically appropriate, if adverse reactions are experienced when administered concomitantly with EPIDIOLEX.  Because of the potential for both induction and inhibition of enzyme activity, consider adjusting dosage of substrates of CYP2B6, as clinically appropriate.

Sensitive CYP2C19 Substrates 

In vivo data show that coadministration of EPIDIOLEX increases plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by (i.e., are substrates of) CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam) and may increase the risk of adverse reactions with these substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  Consider a reduction in dosage of sensitive CYP2C19 substrates, as clinically appropriate, when coadministered with EPIDIOLEX. 

Clobazam

Coadministration of EPIDIOLEX produces a 3-fold increase in plasma concentrations of N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam (a substrate of CYP2C19), with no effect on clobazam levels  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  The increase in N-desmethylclobazam may increase the risk of clobazam-related adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].  Consider a reduction in dosage of clobazam if adverse reactions known to occur with clobazam are experienced when coadministered with EPIDIOLEX.

Stiripentol

Concomitant use of EPIDIOLEX and stiripentol causes an elevation in exposure to stiripentol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  The mechanism of this interaction has not been determined.  The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown, but patients should be monitored for stiripentol-related adverse drug reactions.

Sensitive P-gp Substrates Given Orally

Coadministration of EPIDIOLEX with orally administered everolimus, a P-gp and CYP3A4 substrate, results in an approximately 2.5-fold increase in mean Cmax and AUC of everolimus [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].  When initiating EPIDIOLEX in patients taking everolimus, monitor therapeutic drug levels of everolimus and adjust the dosage accordingly.  When initiating everolimus in patients taking a stable dosage of EPIDIOLEX, a lower starting dose of everolimus is recommended, with therapeutic drug monitoring.
Increases in exposure of other orally administered P-gp substrates (e.g., sirolimus, tacrolimus, digoxin) may be observed on coadministration with EPIDIOLEX.  Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction of other P-gp substrates should be considered when given orally and concurrently with EPIDIOLEX.








7.3  Concomitant Use of EPIDIOLEX and Valproate

Concomitant use of EPIDIOLEX and valproate increases the incidence of liver enzyme elevations [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].  If such elevations occur, discontinuation or reduction of EPIDIOLEX and/or concomitant valproate should be considered.  Insufficient data are available to assess the risk of concomitant administration of other hepatotoxic drugs and EPIDIOLEX.








7.4  CNS Depressants and Alcohol

Concomitant use of EPIDIOLEX with other CNS depressants (including alcohol) may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","rifampin, clobazam, caffeine, theophylline, tizanidine, bupropion, efavirenz, diflunisal, propofol, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, lamotrigine, morphine, lorazepam, phenytoin, diazepam, stiripentol, everolimus, sirolimus, tacrolimus, digoxin, valproate, alcohol"

The formation of CYP450 enzymes can be altered by increased levels of certain cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, interferon) during chronic inflammation.
Results from an exploratory drug-drug interaction study in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis suggested a low potential for clinically relevant drug interactions for drugs metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP1A2 but the interaction potential cannot be ruled out for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6. However, the results were highly variable because of the limited number of subjects in the study.

Certain CYP3A Substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious toxicities




Clinical Effect

Vonoprazan is a weak CYP3A inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].Vonoprazan may increase exposure of CYP3A4 substrates, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.



Prevention or Management

Frequent monitoring for concentrations and/or adverse reactions related to the substrate drugs when used with VOQUEZNA. Dosage reduction of substrate drugs may be needed.See prescribing information for the relevant substrate drugs.



CYP2C19 Substrates (e.g., clopidogrel, citalopram, cilostazol)




Clinical Effect

Vonoprazan is a CYP2C19 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Vonoprazan may reduce plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and may cause reduction in platelet inhibition. Vonoprazan may increase exposure of CYP2C19 substrate drugs (e.g., citalopram, cilostazol).



Prevention or Management

Clopidogrel
Carefully monitor the efficacy of clopidogrel and consider alternative anti-platelet therapy.


Citalopram and Cilostazol
Carefully monitor patients for adverse reactions associated with citalopram and cilostazol. See the prescribing information for dosage adjustments.



Chromogranin (CgA) Test for Neuroendocrine Tumors




Clinical Effect

Vonoprazan reduces intragastric acidity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)], which increases CgA levels and may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors.




Prevention or Management

Assess CgA levels at least 14 days after stopping VOQUEZNA treatment and  repeat the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), use the same commercial laboratory for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.



Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test




Clinical Effect

Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.



Prevention or Management

Temporarily stop VOQUEZNA at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].




Table 9: Drug Interactions Affecting VOQUEZNA When Co-Administered with Other Drugs




Strong or Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers

Maraviroc is metabolized by CYP3A and is also a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)2. The pharmacokinetics of maraviroc are likely to be modulated by inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp and may be modulated by inhibitors of OATP1B1 and MRP2. Therefore, a dosage adjustment may be required when maraviroc is coadministered with those drugs [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].
Concomitant use of maraviroc and St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or products containing St. John's wort is not recommended. Coadministration of maraviroc with St. John's wort is expected to substantially decrease maraviroc concentrations and may result in suboptimal levels of maraviroc and lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance to maraviroc.
Additional drug interaction information is available [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","CYP3A inhibitors, protease inhibitors, tipranavir, ritonavir, CYP3A inducers, efavirenz, St. John’s wort, Hypericum perforatum"

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

 Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on trandolapril and other agents that affect the RAS.
 Do not co-administer aliskiren with trandolapril  in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with trandolapril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).


Concomitant Diuretic Therapy


As with other ACE inhibitors, patients on diuretics, especially those on recently instituted diuretic therapy, may experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with trandolapril. The possibility of exacerbation of hypotensive effects with trandolapril may be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or cautiously increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with trandolapril. If it is not possible to discontinue the diuretic, the starting dose of trandolapril should be reduced. (See 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

.)


Agents Increasing Serum Potassium


Trandolapril can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics and increase serum potassium when used alone. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride), potassium supplements, or potassium-containing salt substitutes concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. If concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be used with caution and with appropriate monitoring of serum potassium. (See 
PRECAUTIONS

.)


Antidiabetic Agents


Concomitant use of ACE inhibitors and antidiabetic medicines (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood glucose lowering effect with greater risk of hypoglycemia.


Lithium


Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended.  If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.


Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)


In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving trandolapril and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including trandolapril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.


Gold


Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including trandolapril.

Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors

 Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema (see Warnings – Head and Neck Angioedema).

 Neprilysin Inhibitor

Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors (e.g., sacubitril) may be at increased risk for angioedema (see 
WARNINGS
).

Table 5: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs, Tyramine, and Vaccines Co-administered with ZEPOSIA






Anti-Neoplastic, Immune-Modulating, or Non-Corticosteroid Immunosuppressive Therapies






Clinical Impact:



ZEPOSIA has not been studied in combination with anti-neoplastic, immune-modulating, or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapies with the exception of cyclosporine, which had no pharmacokinetic interaction [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Prevention or Management:



Caution should be used during concomitant administration because of the risk of additive immune effects during such therapy and in the weeks following administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, the half-life and mode of action of these drugs must be considered in order to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.10)

].
Alemtuzumab: Initiating treatment with ZEPOSIA after alemtuzumab is not recommended because of the characteristics and duration of alemtuzumab immune suppressive effects.
Beta interferon or glatiramer acetate: ZEPOSIA can generally be started immediately after discontinuation of beta interferon or glatiramer acetate.





Anti-Arrhythmic Drugs, QT Prolonging Drugs, Drugs That May Decrease Heart Rate






Clinical Impact:



ZEPOSIA has not been studied in patients taking QT prolonging drugs.Class Ia (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) anti-arrhythmic drugs have been associated with cases of Torsades de Pointes in patients with bradycardia.





Prevention or Management:



If treatment with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on Class Ia or Class III anti-arrhythmic drugs, advice from a cardiologist should be sought [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].Because of the potential additive effects on heart rate, treatment with ZEPOSIA should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with QT prolonging drugs with known arrhythmogenic properties [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If treatment initiation with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on QT prolonging drugs, advice from a cardiologist should be sought.





Adrenergic and Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



Because an active metabolite of ozanimod inhibits MAO-B in vitro, there is a potential for serious adverse reactions, including hypertensive crisis with co-administration of ZEPOSIA with drugs or over-the-counter medications that can increase norepinephrine or serotonin [e.g., opioid drugs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclics, tyramine].
Opioid Drugs
Serious, sometimes fatal reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use of opioid drugs (e.g., meperidine and its derivatives, methadone, or tramadol) and MAOIs, including selective MAO-B inhibitors. Although a small number of patients treated with ZEPOSIA were concomitantly exposed to opioids, this exposure was not adequate to rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction from co-administration.
Serotonergic Drugs
Although a small number of patients treated with ZEPOSIA were concomitantly exposed to serotonergic medications, this exposure was not adequate to rule out the possibility of an adverse reaction from co-administration.
Sympathomimetic Medications
Concomitant use of ZEPOSIA with pseudoephedrine did not potentiate the effects on blood pressure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. However, hypertensive crisis has occurred with administration of ZEPOSIA alone [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.6)

] and hypertensive crisis has been reported with co-administration of other selective and nonselective MAO inhibitors (e.g., rasagiline) with sympathomimetic medications.





Prevention or Management:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with drugs or over-the-counter medications that can increase norepinephrine or serotonin (e.g., opioid drugs, SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, tyramine) is not recommended. Monitor patients for hypertension with concomitant use.





Combination Beta Blocker and Calcium Channel Blocker






Clinical Impact:


The co-administration of ZEPOSIA with both a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker has not been studied. However, there is a potential of additive effects on heart rate.





Prevention or Management:



Treatment with ZEPOSIA should generally not be initiated in patients who are concurrently treated with both a heart rate lowering calcium channel blocker (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem) and beta blocker [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If treatment initiation with ZEPOSIA is considered in patients on both a heart rate lowering calcium channel blocker and beta blocker, advice from a cardiologist should be sought.





Tyramine






Clinical Impact:



MAO in the gastrointestinal tract and liver (primarily type A) provides protection from exogenous amines (e.g., tyramine). If tyramine were absorbed intact, it could lead to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Aged, fermented, cured, smoked, and pickled foods containing large amounts of exogenous amines (e.g., aged cheese, pickled herring) may cause release of norepinephrine resulting in a rise in blood pressure (tyramine reaction).





Prevention or Management:



Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a large amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of ZEPOSIA [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.6)

].





Vaccination






Clinical Impact:



During, and for up to three months after, discontinuation of treatment with ZEPOSIA, vaccinations may be less effective. The use of live attenuated vaccines may carry the risk of infection.





Prevention or Management:



Live attenuated vaccines should be avoided during ZEPOSIA treatment and for up to 3 months after discontinuation of treatment with ZEPOSIA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].





Table 6: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting ZEPOSIA When Co-administered with Other Drugs






Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors






Clinical Impact:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with MAO-B inhibitors may decrease exposure of the active metabolites of ozanimod. In addition, metabolites of ozanimod may inhibit MAO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The potential for a clinical interaction with MAO inhibitors has not been studied; however, the increased risk of nonselective MAO inhibition may lead to a hypertensive crisis.





Prevention or Management:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with MAO inhibitors (e.g., selegiline, phenelzine, linezolid) is contraindicated. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of ZEPOSIA and initiation of treatment with MAO inhibitors.





Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors






Clinical Impact:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors increases the exposure of the active metabolites of ozanimod [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of ZEPOSIA adverse reactions.





Prevention or Management:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors (e.g., gemfibrozil) is not recommended.





Strong CYP2C8 Inducers






Clinical Impact:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces the exposure of the major active metabolites of ozanimod [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease the efficacy of ZEPOSIA.





Prevention or Management:



Co-administration of ZEPOSIA with strong CYP2C8 inducers should be avoided.

7.1 Effects of other drugs on Kerendia 


Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of Kerendia adverse reactions. Concomitant use of Kerendia with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. Avoid concomitant intake of grapefruit or grapefruit juice.  

Moderate and Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use with a moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor increases finerenone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of Kerendia adverse reactions. Monitor serum potassium during drug initiation or dosage adjustment of either Kerendia or the moderate or weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, and adjust Kerendia dosage as appropriate [see Dosing and Administration (

2.3) and Drug Interaction (7.2)].

Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers

Kerendia is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of Kerendia with a strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducer decreases finerenone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the efficacy of Kerendia. Avoid concomitant use of Kerendia with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers.

See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with fenoprophen.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Fenoprofen





Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis




Clinical Impact:



Fenoprofen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of fenoprofen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.





Intervention:

Monitor patients with concomitant use of NALFON with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [
          
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (
           
     
      5.12)
          
    
     ].
         
   
    



Aspirin




Clinical Impact:

Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [
          
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (
           
     
      5.2)
          
    
     ].
         
   
    



Intervention:


Concomitant use of NALFON and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.12)
           
     
      ].
          
    
     
NALFON is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.




ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers




Clinical Impact:



NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of NALFON and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or betablockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
During concomitant use of NALFON, ACE-inhibitors, or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [
            
      
       see Warnings and Precautions (
             
       
        5.6)
            
      
       ].
           
     
      
When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.





Diuretics




Clinical Impact:

Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.



Intervention:

During concomitant use of NALFON with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [
          
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (
           
     
      5.6)
          
    
     ].
         
   
    



Digoxin




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of fenoprofen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.



Intervention:

During concomitant use of NALFON and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.



Lithium




Clinical Impact:

NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.



Intervention:

During concomitant use of NALFON and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.



Methotrexate




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).



Intervention:

During concomitant use of NALFON and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.



Cyclosporine




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of NALFON and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.



Intervention:

During concomitant use of NALFON and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.



NSAIDs and Salicylates




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of fenoprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [
          
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (
           
     
      5.2)
          
    
     ].
         
   
    



Intervention:

The concomitant use of fenoprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.



Pemetrexed




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of NALFON and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).



Intervention:


During concomitant use of NALFON and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.
NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.




Phenobarbital




Clinical Impact:

Chronic administration of phenobarbital, a known enzyme inducer, may be associated with a decrease in the plasma half-life of fenoprofen.



Intervention:

When phenobarbital is added to or withdrawn from treatment, dosage adjustment of NALFON may be required.



Hydantoins, sulfonamides, or sulfonylureas




Clinical Impact:

In vitro studies have shown that fenoprofen, because of its affinity for albumin, may displace from their binding sites other drugs that are also albumin bound, and this may lead to drug interactions. Theoretically, fenoprofen could likewise be displaced.



Intervention:

Patients receiving hydantoins, sulfonamides, or sulfonylureas should be observed for increased activity of these drugs and, therefore, signs of toxicity from these drugs.











Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking NALFON with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of NALFON and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally
          
  
     recommended (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with NALFON may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with NALFON in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

Digoxin: Concomitant use with NALFON can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels (

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Amerlex-M kit assay values of total and free triiodothyronine in patients receiving Nalfon have been reported as falsely elevated on the basis of a chemical cross-reaction that directly interferes with the assay. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, total thyroxine, and thyrotropin-releasing hormone response are not affected. Thus, results of the Amerlex-M kit assay should be interpreted with caution in these patients.","warfarin,aspirin,SSRIs,SNRIs,ACE inhibitors,ARBs,beta-blockers,propranolol,furosemide,thiazide diuretics,digoxin,lithium,methotrexate,cyclosporine,diflunisal,salsalate,pemetrexed,diclofenac,indomethacin,meloxicam,nabumetone,phenobarbital,hydantoins,sulfonamides,sulfonylureas"

Fluoroquinolones form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Oral administration of BAXDELA with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as didanosine buffered tablets for oral suspension or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of BAXDELA, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, BAXDELA should be taken at least 2 hours before or 6 hours after these agents [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].
There are no data concerning an interaction of intravenous BAXDELA with oral antacids, sucralfate, multivitamins, didanosine, or metal cations. However, BAXDELA should not be co-administered with any solution containing multivalent cations, e.g., magnesium, through the same intravenous line [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].","Antacids, Sucralfate, Metal Cations, Multivitamins, Aluminum, Magnesium, Iron, Zinc, Didanosine"

•CYP3A4 Inhibitors: use in combination with CYP3A4 inhibitors could decrease the effectiveness of ifosfamide. (7.2)








7.1 Inducers of CYP3A4

CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, St. John Wort) may increase the metabolism of ifosfamide to its active alkylating metabolites. CYP3A4 inducers may increase the formation of the neurotoxic/nephrotoxic ifosfamide metabolite, chloroacetaldehyde. Closely monitor patients taking ifosfamide with CYP3A4 inducers for toxicities and consider dose adjustment.








7.2 Inhibitors of CYP3A4

CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, sorafenib, aprepitant, fosaprepitant, grapefruit, grapefruit juice) may decrease the metabolism of ifosfamide to its active alkylating metabolites, perhaps decreasing the effectiveness of ifosfamide treatment.","carbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, rifampin, St. John Wort, ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, sorafenib, aprepitant, fosaprepitant, grapefruit, grapefruit juice"

Nephrotoxic Agents, Including Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs



The concurrent use of mesalamine with known nephrotoxic agents, including non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may increase the risk of nephrotoxicity. Monitor patients taking nephrotoxic drugs for changes in renal function and mesalamine-related adverse reactions.









Azathioprine or 6-Mercaptopurine



The concurrent use of mesalamine with azathioprine or 6‑mercaptopurine and/or any other drugs known to cause myelotoxicity (e.g., thioguanine) may increase the risk for blood disorders, bone marrow failure, and associated complications. If concomitant use of DIPENTUM and azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine cannot be avoided, monitor blood tests, including complete blood cell counts and platelet counts.









Low Molecular Weight Heparins or Heparinoids



The co-administration of salicylates and low molecular weight heparins or heparinoids may result in an increased risk of bleeding (i.e., hematomas) following neuraxial anesthesia. Salicylates should be discontinued prior to the initiation of a low molecular weight heparin or heparinoid.

No clinically significant adverse interactions with commonly used preanesthetic drugs, or drugs used during anesthesia (muscle relaxants, intravenous agents, and local anesthetic agents) were reported in clinical trials. The effect of SUPRANE on the disposition of other drugs has not been determined. Similar to isoflurane, SUPRANE does not predispose to premature ventricular arrhythmias in the presence of exogenously infused epinephrine in swine.

Suprane (desflurane, USP) decreases the doses of neuromuscular blocking agents required. Adjust dose accordingly. (7.2)








7.1 Benzodiazepines and Opioids (MAC Reduction)

Benzodiazepines and opioids decrease the amount of desflurane (MAC) needed to produce anesthesia. This effect is shown in Table 3 for intravenous midazolam (25-50 ug/kg) and intravenous fentanyl (3-6 ug/kg) in patients of two different age groups.







Table3.jpg











7.2 Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

Anesthetic concentrations of desflurane at equilibrium (administered for 15 or more minutes before testing) reduced the ED95 of succinylcholine by approximately 30% and that of atracurium and pancuronium by approximately 50% compared to N2O/opioid anesthesia ﻿(see Table 4). ﻿The effect of desflurane on duration of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blockade has not been studied.



Dosage reduction of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation, because potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with the delivered partial pressure of SUPRANE.
Among nondepolarizing drugs, pancuronium, atracurium, and vecuronium interactions have been studied. In the absence of specific guidelines:

For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants or succinylcholine.
During maintenance of anesthesia, the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation.

No formal clinical studies of drug interactions have been conducted with ABELCET
 
  ®. However, when administered concomitantly, the following drugs are known to interact with amphotericin B; therefore, the following drugs may interact with ABELCET
 
  ®:

 

Antineoplastic agents:Concurrent use of antineoplastic agents and amphotericin B may enhance the potential for renal toxicity, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Antineoplastic agents should be given concomitantly with ABELCET
 
  ®with great caution.

 

Corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH):Concurrent use of corticosteroids and corticotropin (ACTH) with amphotericin B may potentiate hypokalemia which could predispose the patient to cardiac dysfunction. If used concomitantly with ABELCET
 
  ®, serum electrolytes and cardiac function should be closely monitored.

 

Cyclosporin A:Data from a prospective study of prophylactic ABELCET
 
  ®in 22 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation suggested that concurrent initiation of cyclosporin A and ABELCET
 
  ®within several days of bone marrow ablation may be associated with increased nephrotoxicity.

 

Digitalis glycosides:Concurrent use of amphotericin B may induce hypokalemia and may potentiate digitalis toxicity. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET
 
  ®, serum potassium levels should be closely monitored.

 

Flucytosine: Concurrent use of flucytosine with amphotericin B-containing preparations may increase the toxicity of flucytosine by possibly increasing its cellular uptake and/or impairing its renal excretion. Flucytosine should be given concomitantly with ABELCET
 
  ®with caution. 

 

Imidazoles (e.g., ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, fluconazole, etc.):Antagonism between amphotericin B and imidazole derivatives such as miconazole and ketoconazole, which inhibit ergosterol synthesis, has been reported in both in vitro and in vivo animal studies. The clinical significance of these findings has not been determined. 

 

Leukocyte transfusions:Acute pulmonary toxicity has been reported in patients receiving intravenous amphotericin B and leukocyte transfusions. Leukocyte transfusions and ABELCET
 
  ®should not be given concurrently.

 

Other nephrotoxic medications: Concurrent use of amphotericin B and agents such as aminoglcosides and pentamidine may enhance the potential for drug-induced renal toxicity. Aminoglycosides and pentamidine should be used concomitantly with ABELCET
 
  ®only with great caution. Intensive monitoring of renal function is recommended in patients requiring any combination of nephrotoxic medications.

 

Skeletal muscle relaxants:Amphotericin B-induced hypokalemia may enhance the curariform effect of skeletal muscle relaxants (e.g., tubocurarine) due to hypokalemia. When administered concomitantly with ABELCET

Table 4	Clinically Relevant Interactions with JARDIANCE




Diuretics





Clinical Impact

Coadministration of empagliflozin with diuretics resulted in increased urine volume and frequency of voids, which might enhance the potential for volume depletion.



Intervention

Before initiating JARDIANCE, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating JARDIANCE. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy.



Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues




Clinical Impact

The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when JARDIANCE is used in combination with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin.



Intervention

Coadministration of JARDIANCE with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may require lower dosages of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.



Lithium




Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations.



Intervention

Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during JARDIANCE initiation and dosage changes.



Positive Urine Glucose Test




Clinical Impact

SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion and will lead to positive urine glucose tests.



Intervention

Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.



Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay




Clinical Impact

Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.



Intervention

Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.

Fidaxomicin and its main metabolite, OP-1118, are substrates of the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which is expressed in the gastrointestinal tract.






7.1	Cyclosporine

Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of multiple transporters, including P-gp. When cyclosporine was co-administered with DIFICID, plasma concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 were significantly increased but remained in the ng/mL range [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concentrations of fidaxomicin and OP-1118 may also be decreased at the site of action (i.e., gastrointestinal tract) via P-gp inhibition; however, concomitant P-gp inhibitor use had no attributable effect on safety or treatment outcome of fidaxomicin-treated adult patients in controlled clinical trials. Based on these results, fidaxomicin may be co-administered with P-gp inhibitors and no dose adjustment is recommended.",Cyclosporine

With diuretics: Patients on diuretics, especially those with intravascular volume depletion, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with fosinopril sodium. The possibility of hypotensive effects with fosinopril sodium can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with fosinopril sodium. If this is not possible, the starting dose should be reduced and the patient should be observed closely for several hours following an initial dose and until blood pressure has stabilized. (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).

With potassium supplements and potassium-sparing diuretics: Fosinopril sodium can attenuate potassium loss caused by thiazide diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) or potassium supplements can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution, and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently.

With lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be co administered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.

With antacids: In a clinical pharmacology study, coadministration of an antacid (aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and simethicone) with fosinopril reduced serum levels and urinary excretion of fosinoprilat as compared with fosinopril administrated alone, suggesting that antacids may impair absorption of fosinopril. Therefore, if concomitant administration of these agents is indicated, dosing should be separated by 2 hours.

Gold: Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including fosinopril sodium.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors):In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving quinapril and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including fosinopril may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

Agents that inhibit mTOR: Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. 

  Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS):Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in  patients on fosinopril and other agents that affect the RAS. 
Do not co-administer aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with fosinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min).

Other: Neither fosinopril sodium nor its metabolites have been found to interact with food. In separate single or multiple dose pharmacokinetic interaction studies with chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, and warfarin, the bioavailability of fosinoprilat was not altered by coadministration of fosinopril with any one of these drugs. In a study with concomitant administration of aspirin and fosinopril sodium, the bioavailability of unbound fosinoprilat was not altered.
In a pharmacokinetic interaction study with warfarin, bioavailability parameters, the degree of protein binding, and the anticoagulant effect (measured by prothrombin time) of warfarin were not significantly changed.","spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, lithium, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, simethicone, sodium aurothiomalate, temsirolimus, angiotensin receptor blockers, aliskiren, chlorthalidone, nifedipine, propranolol, hydrochlorothiazide, cimetidine, metoclopramide, propantheline, digoxin, warfarin, aspirin"

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions With Triazolam

Table 2 includes clinically significant drug interactions with triazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
.


Table 2: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Triazolam 



Opioids







Clinical implication


 The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists.




Prevention or management
 Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of triazolam and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].



CNS Depressants




Clinical implication

Triazolam produces additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with other CNS depressants.



Prevention or management

Limit dosage and duration of triazolam during concomitant use with CNS depressants.



Strong Inhibitors of CYP 3A




Clinical implication

Concomitant use of triazolam with strong CYP3A inhibitors has a profound effect on the clearance of triazolam, resulting in increased concentrations of triazolam and increased risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Prevention or management

Do not administer triazolam with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
.




Moderate and Weak Inhibitors of CYP 3A




Clinical implication

Concomitant use of triazolam with moderate or weak inhibitors of CYP3A inhibitors may increase the concentrations of triazolam, resulting in increased risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
.




Prevention or management

Use with caution and consider appropriate dose reduction of triazolam when coadministered with moderate and weak CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]
.




Strong Inducers of CYP 3A




Clinical implication

Coadministration of triazolam with strong inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly decrease the plasma concentration of triazolam and may decrease effiectiveness of triazolam.



Prevention or management

Caution is recommended during coadministration of triazolam with strong inducers of CYP3A4.



Interactions Based on Experience with Other Benzodiazepines or in vitro Studies with Triazolam




Clinical implication

Available data from clinical studies of benzodiazepines other than triazolam, from in vitro studies with triazolam, or from in vitro studies with benzodiazepines other than triazolam suggest a possible drug interaction with triazolam [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)].




Prevention or management

Caution is recommended during coadministration of triazolam tablets with any of these drugs. [see Warnings and Precautions

When amiloride HCl is administered concomitantly with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, cyclosporine or tacrolimus, the risk of hyperkalemia may be increased. Therefore, if concomitant use of these agents is indicated because of demonstrated hypokalemia, they should be used with caution and with frequent monitoring of serum potassium. (See WARNINGS.)
Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity. Read circulars for lithium preparations before use of such concomitant therapy.
In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics. Therefore, when amiloride HCl and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are used concomitantly, the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained. Since indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics, including amiloride HCl, may each be associated with increased serum potassium levels, the potential effects on potassium kinetics and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.","angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin II receptor antagonist, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, lithium, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, indomethacin"

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on RETEVMO








Acid-Reducing Agents

Concomitant use of RETEVMO with acid-reducing agents decreases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce RETEVMO anti-tumor activity.

Avoid concomitant use of PPIs, H2 receptor antagonists, and locally-acting antacids with RETEVMO. If coadministration cannot be avoided, take RETEVMO with food (with a PPI) or modify its administration time (with a H2 receptor antagonist or a locally-acting antacid) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].











Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors

Concomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor increases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of RETEVMO adverse reactions, including QTc interval prolongation.

Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors with RETEVMO. If concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inhibitors cannot be avoided, reduce the RETEVMO dosage and monitor the QT interval with ECGs more frequently [see Dosage and Administration (2.6), Warning and Precautions (5.4)].

Concomitant use of RETEVMO with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases selpercatinib plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce RETEVMO anti-tumor activity.

Avoid coadministration of strong or moderate CYP3A inducers with RETEVMO.











7.2 Effects of RETEVMO on Other Drugs








CYP2C8 and CYP3A Substrates

RETEVMO is a moderate CYP2C8 inhibitor and a weak CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use of RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates increases their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of RETEVMO with CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for CYP2C8 and CYP3A substrates provided in their approved product labeling.











Certain P-gp Substrates

RETEVMO is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates increases their plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Avoid coadministration of RETEVMO with P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to increased adverse reactions. If coadministration cannot be avoided, follow recommendations for P-gp substrates provided in their approved product labeling.

See full prescribing information for PRIALT.PRIALT (ziconotide) solution, intrathecal infusion Initial U.S. Approval: 2004",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


Formal PK drug-drug interaction studies have not been performed with PRIALT. As ziconotide is a peptide, it is expected to be completely degraded by endopeptidases and exopeptidases (Phase I hydrolytic enzymes) widely located throughout the body, and not by other Phase I biotransformation processes (including the cytochrome P450 system) or by Phase II conjugation reactions. Thus, intrathecal administration, low plasma ziconotide concentrations, and metabolism by ubiquitous peptidases make metabolic interactions of other drugs with ziconotide unlikely. Further, as ziconotide is not highly bound in plasma (approximately 50%) and has low plasma exposure following intrathecal administration, clinically relevant plasma protein displacement reactions involving ziconotide and co-administered medications are unlikely.

Over 90% of patients treated with intrathecal PRIALT used systemic opiates and in the slow titration study, 98% of patients received opioids.

The combination of PRIALT with intrathecal opiates has not been studied in placebo-controlled clinical trials and is not recommended.







Combination of PRIALT with intrathecal opiates is not recommended. (7)

In a drug interaction study in 16 healthy male volunteers, coadministration of multiple doses of zafirlukast (160 mg/day) to steady-state with a single 25 mg dose of warfarin resulted in a significant increase in the mean AUC (+ 63%) and half-life (+36%) of S-warfarin. The mean prothrombin time (PT) increased by approximately 35%. This interaction is probably due to an inhibition by zafirlukast of the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme system. Patients on oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy and zafirlukast should have their prothrombin times monitored closely and anticoagulant dose adjusted accordingly (see WARNINGS, Concomitant Warfarin Administration). No formal drug-drug interaction studies with zafirlukast and other drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2C9 isoenzyme (e.g., tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine) have been conducted; however, care should be exercised when zafirlukast is coadministered with these drugs.

In a drug interaction study in 11 asthmatic patients, coadministration of a single dose of zafirlukast (40 mg) with erythromycin (500 mg three times daily for 5 days) to steady-state resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 40% due to a decrease in zafirlukast bioavailability.

Coadministration of zafirlukast (20 mg/day) or placebo at steady-state with a single dose of sustained release theophylline preparation (16 mg/kg) in 16 healthy boys and girls (6 through 11 years of age) resulted in no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of theophylline.

Coadministration of zafirlukast (80 mg/day) at steady-state with a single dose of a liquid theophylline preparation (6 mg/kg) in 13 asthmatic patients, 18 to 44 years of age, resulted in decreased mean plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 30%, but no effect on plasma theophylline levels was observed.

Rare cases of patients experiencing increased theophylline levels with or without clinical signs or symptoms of theophylline toxicity after the addition of zafirlukast to an existing theophylline regimen have been reported. The mechanism of the interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline in these patients is unknown (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Coadministration of zafirlukast (40 mg/day) with aspirin (650 mg four times daily) resulted in mean increased plasma levels of zafirlukast by approximately 45%.

In a single-blind, parallel-group, 3-week study in 39 healthy female subjects taking oral contraceptives, 40 mg twice daily of zafirlukast had no significant effect on ethinyl estradiol plasma concentrations or contraceptive efficacy.

Coadministration of zafirlukast with fluconazole, a moderate CYP2C9 inhibitor, resulted in increased plasma levels of zafirlukast, by approximately 58% (90% CI:28, 95). The clinical significance of this interaction is unknown. Zafirlukast exposure is likely to be increased by other moderate and strong CYP2C9 inhibitors. Coadministration of zafirlukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, caused no change in plasma levels of zafirlukast.

No other formal drug-drug interaction studies between zafirlukast and marketed drugs known to be metabolized by the P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme (e.g., dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride) have been conducted. As zafirlukast is known to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vitro, it is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when these drugs are coadministered with zafirlukast.","warfarin, tolbutamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine, erythromycin, theophylline, aspirin, ethinyl estradiol, fluconazole, itraconazole, dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers, cyclosporin, cisapride"

Examples:

carvedilol, lisinopril, prazosin




Benzodiazepines




Clinical Impact:

The intensity of sedation was greater with the combination of oral aripiprazole and lorazepam as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone. The orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lorazepam alone [see Warnings and Precautions

7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with ARISTADA


Based on pharmacokinetic studies with oral aripiprazole, no dosage adjustment of ARISTADA is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, or lithium [see Clinical Pharmacology

(
12.3
)].

In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin, escitalopram), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with ARISTADA. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, or sertraline when co-administered with ARISTADA [see Clinical Pharmacology

(
12.3
)].","itraconazole, clarithromycin, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, carbamazepine, rifampin, carvedilol, lisinopril, prazosin, lorazepam, famotidine, valproate, lithium, dextromethorphan, venlafaxine, warfarin, omeprazole, escitalopram, lamotrigine, sertraline"

Carbamazepine: May need dose adjustment for APTIOM or carbamazepine. (2.3, 5.6, 7.1)

Phenytoin: Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary and dose adjustment may be needed for phenytoin. (2.3, 7.1, 7.2)

Phenobarbital or Primidone:  Higher dosage of APTIOM may be necessary. (2.3, 7.1)

Hormonal Contraceptives:  APTIOM may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. (7.4, 8.3)









7.1 Other Antiepileptic Drugs


Several AEDs (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and primidone) can induce enzymes that metabolize APTIOM and can cause decreased plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Higher doses of Aptiom may be needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].









7.2 CYP2C19 Substrates


APTIOM can inhibit CYP2C19, which can cause increased plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., phenytoin, clobazam, and omeprazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment may be needed.









7.3 CYP3A4 Substrates



In vivo studies suggest that APTIOM can induce CYP3A4, decreasing plasma concentrations of drugs that are metabolized by this isoenzyme (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Dose adjustment of simvastatin and lovastatin may be needed if a clinically significant change in lipids is noted.









7.4 Oral Contraceptives


Because concomitant use of APTIOM and ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel is associated with lower plasma levels of these hormones, females of reproductive potential should use additional or alternative non-hormonal birth control.","Carbamazepine,Phenytoin,Phenobarbital,Primidone,Hormonal Contraceptives,Clobazam,Omeprazole,Simvastatin,Lovastatin,Ethinylestradiol,Levonorgestrel"

7.1 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions








Effects of Telavancin on Coagulation Test Parameters

Telavancin binds to the artificial phospholipid surfaces added to common anticoagulation tests, thereby interfering with the ability of the coagulation complexes to assemble on the surface of the phospholipids and promote clotting in vitro. These effects appear to depend on the type of reagents used in commercially available assays. Thus, when measured shortly after completion of an infusion of VIBATIV, increases in the PT, INR, aPTT, and ACT have been observed. These effects dissipate over time, as plasma concentrations of telavancin decrease.

7.1 Effect of VYLEESI on Other Drugs


VYLEESI may slow gastric emptying and thus has the potential to reduce the rate and extent of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. Instruct patients to avoid the use of VYLEESI when taking concomitant oral drugs that are dependent on threshold concentrations for efficacy (e.g., antibiotics). In addition, patients should consider discontinuing VYLEESI if there is a delayed drug effect of concomitant oral medications when a quick onset of drug effect is desired (e.g. drugs for pain relief such as indomethacin).









7.2 Naltrexone


As VYLEESI may significantly decrease the systemic exposure of orally-administered naltrexone, patients should avoid using VYLEESI with an orally administered naltrexone-containing product that is intended to treat alcohol and opioid addiction due to the severe consequence of naltrexone treatment failure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","naltrexone,indomethacin"

See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with oxaprozin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 2. Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Oxaprozin






Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis






Clinical Impact





•Oxaprozin and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of oxaprozin and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.

•Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.






Intervention



Monitor patients with concomitant use of oxaprozin with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.12

)].





Aspirin






Clinical Impact



Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].





Intervention



Concomitant use of oxaprozin and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)
].





Oxaprozin is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.





ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical Impact





•NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol).

•In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.






Intervention





•During concomitant use of oxaprozin and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.

•During concomitant use of oxaprozin and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].


•When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.






Diuretics






Clinical Impact



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].





Digoxin






Clinical Impact



The concomitant use of oxaprozin with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical Impact



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction) because NSAID administration may result in increased plasma levels of methotrexate, especially in patients receiving high doses of methotrexate.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact



Concomitant use of oxaprozin and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical Impact



Concomitant use of oxaprozin with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].






Intervention



The concomitant use of oxaprozin with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical Impact



Concomitant use of oxaprozin and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.




NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.




In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.





Corticosteroids






Clinical Impact



Concomitant use of corticosteroids with oxaprozin may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.





Intervention



Monitor patients with concomitant use of oxaprozin with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].





Glyburide






Clinical Impact



While oxaprozin does alter the pharmacokinetics of glyburide, coadministration of oxaprozin to type II non-insulin dependent diabetic patients did not affect the area under the glucose concentration curve nor the magnitude or duration of control.





Intervention



During concomitant use of oxaprozin and glyburide, monitor patient's blood glucose in the beginning phase of cotherapy.






Laboratory Test Interactions


False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for benzodiazepines have been reported in patients taking oxaprozin. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of oxaprozin therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish oxaprozin from benzodiazepines.

See full prescribing information for lapatinib tablets. LAPATINIB tablets, for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 2007",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS





Lapatinib tablets are likely to increase exposure to concomitantly administered drugs which are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or P-glycoprotein (ABCB1). (7.1)
Avoid strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. If unavoidable, consider dose reduction of lapatinib tablets in patients coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. (2.2, 7.2) 
Avoid strong CYP3A4 inducers. If unavoidable, consider gradual dose increase of lapatinib tablets in patients coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inducer. (2.2, 7.2) 








7.1 Effects of Lapatinib on Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Drug Transport Systems


Lapatinib inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C8, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) in vitro at clinically relevant concentrations and is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4 in vivo. Caution should be exercised and dose reduction of the concomitant substrate drug should be considered when dosing lapatinib tablets concurrently with medications with narrow therapeutic windows that are substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, or P-gp. Lapatinib did not significantly inhibit the following enzymes in human liver microsomes: CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 or UGT enzymes in vitro, however, the clinical significance is unknown.
Midazolam: Following coadministration of lapatinib tablets and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), 24-hour systemic exposure (AUC) of orally administered midazolam increased 45%, while 24-hour AUC of intravenously administered midazolam increased 22%. 


Paclitaxel: In cancer patients receiving lapatinib tablets and paclitaxel (CYP2C8 and P-gp substrate), 24-hour systemic exposure (AUC) of paclitaxel was increased 23%. This increase in paclitaxel exposure may have been underestimated from the in vivo evaluation due to study design limitations. 

Digoxin: Following coadministration of lapatinib tablets and digoxin (P-gp substrate), systemic AUC of an oral digoxin dose increased approximately 2.8-fold. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored prior to initiation of lapatinib tablets and throughout coadministration. If digoxin serum concentration is greater than 1.2 ng/mL, the digoxin dose should be reduced by half.








7.2 Drugs That Inhibit or Induce Cytochrome P450 3A4 Enzymes

Lapatinib undergoes extensive metabolism by CYP3A4, and concomitant administration of strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 alter lapatinib concentrations significantly (see Ketoconazole and Carbamazepine sections, below). Dose adjustment of lapatinib should be considered for patients who must receive concomitant strong inhibitors or concomitant strong inducers of CYP3A4 enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].   

Ketoconazole: In healthy subjects receiving ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor, at 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to lapatinib was increased to approximately 3.6-fold of control and half-life increased to 1.7-fold of control.   

Carbamazepine: In healthy subjects receiving the CYP3A4 inducer, carbamazepine, at 100 mg twice daily for 3 days and 200 mg twice daily for 17 days, systemic exposure (AUC) to lapatinib was decreased approximately 72%.








7.3 Drugs That Inhibit Drug Transport Systems

Lapatinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1). If lapatinib tablets  are administered with drugs that inhibit P-gp, increased concentrations of lapatinib are likely, and caution should be exercised.

7.1 Oral Medications

TRULICITY delays gastric emptying and thus has the potential to reduce the rate of absorption of concomitantly administered oral medications. The delay in gastric emptying is dose-dependent but is attenuated with the recommended dose escalation to higher doses of TRULICITY [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. The delay is largest after the first dose and diminishes with subsequent doses. In clinical pharmacology studies, TRULICITY 1.5 mg did not affect the absorption of the tested orally administered medications to a clinically relevant degree [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is limited experience with the use of concomitant medications in clinical trials with TRULICITY doses of 3 mg and 4.5 mg.

Toremifene: Concomitant use can delay recovery. (7.2)

Hormonal contraceptives: Patients must use an additional, non-hormonal method of contraception for 7 days following BRIDION administration. (5.6, 7.3)







7.1     Summary

The information reported in sections 7.2 – 7.4 is based on binding affinity between BRIDION and other drugs, preclinical experiments, clinical studies and simulations of a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model. Based on these considerations, no clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions with other drugs are expected, with the exception of toremifene and hormonal contraceptives.








7.2     Interactions Potentially Affecting the Efficacy of BRIDION







Toremifene

For toremifene, which has a relatively high binding affinity for sugammadex and for which relatively high plasma concentrations might be present, some displacement of vecuronium or rocuronium from the complex with BRIDION could occur. The recovery to TOF ratio to 0.9 could therefore be delayed in patients who have received toremifene on the same day of surgery.










7.3     Interaction Potentially Affecting the Efficacy of Hormonal Contraceptives


In vitro binding studies indicate that BRIDION may bind to progestogen, thereby decreasing progestogen exposure. Therefore, the administration of a bolus dose of BRIDION is considered to be equivalent to missing dose(s) of oral contraceptives containing an estrogen or progestogen. If an oral contraceptive is taken on the same day that BRIDION is administered, the patient must use an additional, non-hormonal contraceptive method or back-up method of contraception (such as condoms and spermicides) for the next 7 days.
In the case of non-oral hormonal contraceptives, the patient must use an additional, non-hormonal contraceptive method or back-up method of contraception (such as condoms and spermicides) for the next 7 days.








7.4     Interference with Laboratory Tests

BRIDION may interfere with the serum progesterone assay. Interference with this test was observed at sugammadex plasma concentrations of 100 mcg/mL, which may be observed for up to 30 minutes after a 16 mg/kg dose.","Toremifene, hormonal contraceptives, progestogen, estrogen"

The potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions posed by dolasetron and hydrodolasetron appears to be low for drugs commonly used in chemotherapy because hydrodolasetron is eliminated by multiple routes.  See 

PRECAUTIONS, General

 for information about potential interaction with other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. 
When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was co-administered with cimetidine (300 mg four times daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure (i.e., AUC) of hydrodolasetron increased by 24% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron increased by 15%. When oral dolasetron (200 mg once daily) was co-administered with rifampin (600 mg once daily) for 7 days, the systemic exposure of hydrodolasetron decreased by 28% and the maximum plasma concentration of hydrodolasetron decreased by 17%. 
Caution should be exercised when ANZEMET is co-administered with drugs, including those used in chemotherapy, that prolong ECG intervals and/or cause hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia (see

CYP2D6, CYP3A4 or P-gp Substrates: Appropriately monitor or dose titrate narrow therapeutic index drugs that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4 or are P-gp substrates when co-administered with ORLADEYO. (7.2, 12.3)







7.1	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect ORLADEYO







P-gp Inducers

Berotralstat is a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin, St. John's wort) may decrease berotralstat plasma concentration, leading to reduced efficacy of ORLADEYO. The use of P-gp inducers is not recommended with ORLADEYO.










7.2	Potential for ORLADEYO to Affect Other Drugs







CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Substrates

ORLADEYO at a dose of 150 mg is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. For concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index that are predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., thioridazine, pimozide) or CYP3A4 (e.g., cyclosporine, fentanyl), appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Desogestrel

In a drug interaction study conducted in healthy women of childbearing potential (N=22), co-administration of ORLADEYO at a dose of 150 mg at steady state with a single dose of 0.15 mg/0.03 mg desogestrel/ethinyl estradiol resulted in increased exposure to etonogestrel, the active metabolite of desogestrel. If ORLADEYO is co-administered with desogestrel, any potential risk of concurrent use of desogestrel should be weighed against benefit [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









P-gp Substrates


ORLADEYO at a dose of 300 mg is a P-gp inhibitor. Appropriate monitoring and dose titration is recommended for P-gp substrates (e.g., digoxin) when co-administering with ORLADEYO [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","rifampin, St. John's wort, thioridazine, pimozide, cyclosporine, fentanyl, desogestrel, ethinyl estradiol, digoxin"

Drug combinations containing immunosuppressants and/or bone marrow depressants and/or radiation interfere with the development of the immune response and should not be used in combination with TICE BCG. Antimicrobial therapy for other infections may interfere with the effectiveness of TICE BCG. There are no data to suggest that the acute, local urinary tract toxicity common with BCG is due to mycobacterial infection, and antituberculosis drugs (e.g., isoniazid) should not be used to prevent or treat the local, irritative toxicities of TICE BCG.","immunosuppressants,bone marrow depressants,radiation,antimicrobial therapy,antituberculosis drugs,isoniazid"

The risk of using Parlodel in combination with other drugs has not been systematically evaluated, but alcohol may potentiate the side effects of Parlodel. Parlodel may interact with dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, and certain other agents. Compounds in these categories result in a decreased efficacy of Parlodel: phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, and pimozide. Bromocriptine is a substrate of CYP3A4. Caution should therefore be used when co-administering drugs which are strong inhibitors of this enzyme (such as azole antimycotics, HIV protease inhibitors). The concomitant use of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin was shown to increase the plasma levels of bromocriptine (mean AUC and Cmax values increased 3.7-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively).1 The concomitant treatment of acromegalic patients with bromocriptine and octreotide led to increased plasma levels of bromocriptine (bromocriptine AUC increased about 38%).4 Concomitant use of Parlodel with other ergot alkaloids is not recommended. Dose adjustment may be necessary in those cases where high doses of bromocriptine are being used (such as Parkinson’s disease indication).","alcohol, dopamine antagonists, butyrophenones, phenothiazines, haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide, azole antimycotics, HIV protease inhibitors, macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin, octreotide, ergot alkaloids"

Hyperammonemia may be induced by haloperidol and by valproic acid. Monitor ammonia levels closely when use of valproic acid or haloperidol is necessary in patients with UCDs.










7.2	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect RAVICTI







Probenecid

Probenecid may inhibit the renal excretion of metabolites of RAVICTI including PAGN and PAA.










7.3		Potential for RAVICTI to Affect Other Drugs







Drugs with narrow therapeutic index that are substrates of CYP3A4

RAVICTI is a weak inducer of CYP3A4 in humans. Concomitant use of RAVICTI may decrease the systemic exposure to drugs that are substrates of CYP3A4. Monitor for decreased efficacy of drugs with narrow therapeutic index (e.g., alfentanil, quinidine, cyclosporine) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










Midazolam

Concomitant use of RAVICTI decreased the systemic exposure of midazolam. Monitor for suboptimal effect of midazolam in patients who are being treated with RAVICTI.","Corticosteroids, valproic acid, haloperidol, probenecid, alfentanil, quinidine, cyclosporine, midazolam"

     .
   
    



Examples:

Rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, ritonavir



Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues




Clinical Impact:

The risk of hypoglycemia is increased when INVOKANA is used concomitantly with insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin.



Intervention:

Concomitant use may require a lower dosage of the insulin secretagogue or insulin to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia.



Digoxin




Clinical Impact:

Canagliflozin increases digoxin exposure
    
     [see
     
      Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
    
     .
   
    



Intervention:

Monitor patients taking INVOKANA with concomitant digoxin for a need to adjust the dosage of digoxin.



Lithium




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations.



Intervention:

Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during INVOKANA initiation and dosage changes.



Drug/Laboratory Test Interference



  
    
     
Positive Urine Glucose Test





Clinical Impact:

SGLT2 inhibitors increase urinary glucose excretion which will lead to positive urine glucose tests.



Intervention:

Monitoring glycemic control with urine glucose tests is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.


  
    
     
Interference with 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) Assay





Clinical Impact:

Measurements of 1,5-AG are unreliable in assessing glycemic control in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors.



Intervention:

Monitoring glycemic control with 1,5-AG assay is not recommended in patients taking SGLT2 inhibitors. Use alternative methods to monitor glycemic control.

7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers







 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

 Tolvaptan AUC was 5.4 times as large and Cmax was 3.5 times as large after co-administration of tolvaptan and 200 mg ketoconazole [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)  and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Larger doses of the strong CYP3A inhibitor would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. Concomitant use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. 











 Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors

 A substantial increase in the exposure to tolvaptan would be expected when tolvaptan tablets are co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid co-administration of tolvaptan tablets with moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Patients should avoid grapefruit juice beverages while taking tolvaptan tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 











Strong CYP3A Inducers

  Co-administration of tolvaptan tablets with strong CYP3A inducers reduces exposure to tolvaptan tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of tolvaptan tablets with strong CYP3A inducers.










7.2 Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, Angiotensin         Converting Enzyme Inhibitors and Potassium         Sparing Diuretics

Although specific interaction studies were not performed, in clinical studies tolvaptan was used concomitantly with beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics. Adverse reactions of hyperkalemia were approximately 1 to 2% higher when tolvaptan was administered with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and potassium sparing diuretics compared to administration of these medications with placebo. Serum potassium levels should be monitored during concomitant drug therapy.

7.1	Vaccines

Most PsA patients receiving Enbrel were able to mount effective B-cell immune responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, but titers in aggregate were moderately lower and fewer patients had 2-fold rises in titers compared to patients not receiving Enbrel.  The clinical significance of this is unknown.  Patients receiving Enbrel may receive concurrent vaccinations, except for live vaccines.  No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection by live vaccines in patients receiving Enbrel.
Patients with a significant exposure to varicella virus should temporarily discontinue Enbrel therapy and be considered for prophylactic treatment with varicella zoster immune globulin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8, 5.10)].








7.2	Immune-Modulating Biologic Products 

In a study in which patients with active RA were treated for up to 24 weeks with concurrent Enbrel and anakinra therapy, a 7% rate of serious infections was observed, which was higher than that observed with Enbrel alone (0%) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)] and did not result in higher ACR response rates compared to Enbrel alone.  The most common infections consisted of bacterial pneumonia (4 cases) and cellulitis (4 cases).  One patient with pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonia died due to respiratory failure.  Two percent of patients treated concurrently with Enbrel and anakinra developed neutropenia (ANC < 1 × 109/L).

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Codeine Sulfate Tablets






Inhibitors of CYP3A4






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of Codeine Sulfate Tablets with CYP3A4 inhibitors, may result in an increase in codeine plasma concentrations with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Codeine Sulfate Tablets is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, it may result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via CYP2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to codeine.





Intervention:



If concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitor is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Codeine Sulfate Tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients at frequent intervals for respiratory depression and sedation. 
If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Codeine Sulfate Tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Assess for signs of opioid withdrawal.





Examples:



Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)





CYP3A4 Inducers






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and CYP3A4 inducers can result in lower codeine levels, greater norcodeine levels, and less metabolism via 2D6 with resultant lower morphine levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.7

)].
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, codeine plasma concentrations may increase with subsequently greater metabolism by cytochrome CYP2D6, resulting in greater morphine levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.





Intervention:



If concomitant use of a CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, evaluate patients at frequent intervals for reduced efficacy and signs of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the Codeine Sulfate Tablets dosage as needed. 
If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Codeine Sulfate Tablets dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.





Examples:



Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin





Inhibitors of CYP2D6






Clinical Impact:



Codeine is metabolized by CYP2D6 to form morphine. The concomitant use of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of codeine, but can decrease the plasma concentration of active metabolite morphine, which could result in reduced analgesic efficacy or symptoms of opioid withdrawal, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Codeine Sulfate Tablets is achieved [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the codeine plasma concentration will decrease but the active metabolite morphine plasma concentration will increase, which could increase or prolong adverse reactions and may cause potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Intervention:



If concomitant use with a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, or if a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued after concomitant use, consider dosage adjustment of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and evaluate patients at frequent intervals.
If concomitant use with CYP2D6 inhibitors is necessary, evaluate patients for reduced efficacy or signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the dosage of Codeine Sulfate Tablets as needed. 
After stopping use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor, consider reducing the dosage of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression or sedation.





Examples:



Paroxetine, fluoxetine, bupropion, quinidine.





Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants






Clinical Impact:



Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.





Intervention:



Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 

5.2, 5.3)].





Examples:



Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. 





Intervention:



If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Codeine Sulfate Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.





Examples:



Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].






Intervention:



Do not use Codeine Sulfate Tablets in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 
If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses of other opioids (such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, or buprenorphine) to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.





Examples:



Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid.





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics






Clinical Impact:



May reduce the analgesic effect of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.





Intervention:



Avoid concomitant use.





Examples:



Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine.





Muscle Relaxants






Clinical Impact:



Codeine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.





Intervention:



Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of Codeine Sulfate Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (

5.2, 5.3)].






Examples:



Cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone.





Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.





Intervention:



Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.





Intervention:



Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Codeine Sulfate Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.

CNS Depressants: Downward dose adjustment may be necessary due to additive effects. (
  
     7.2)
 
    








7.1 Opioids

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA
 
  Asites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

 








7.2 CNS Depressants

Benzodiazepines, including flurazepam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when co-administered with ethanol or other CNS depressants (e.g., psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines). Downward dose adjustment of flurazepam and/or concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary because of additive effects.","benzodiazepines, opioids, ethanol, psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistamines"

7.1	Effect of Other Drugs on FINTEPLA







Stiripentol Plus Clobazam

Coadministration of FINTEPLA with stiripentol plus clobazam, with or without valproate, increases fenfluramine plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol plus clobazam, the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (maximum daily dosage of 17 mg) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].










Strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A Inducers

Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations, which may lower the efficacy of FINTEPLA [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
It is recommended to avoid coadministration of strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A inducers. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary, monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

If a strong CYP1A2, CYP2B6, or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA, consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].











Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Coadministration of FINTEPLA with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors, the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA, consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors; however, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor, do not exceed the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA of 17 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].











7.2	Effects of Serotonin Receptor Antagonists

Cyproheptadine and potent 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonists may decrease the efficacy of FINTEPLA. If cyproheptadine or potent 5--HT1A, 5--HT1D, 5-HT2A, or 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonists are coadministered with FINTEPLA, patients should be monitored appropriately.

CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers

: Nisoldipine is substrate of CYP3A4 and coadministration of Nisoldipine with any known inducer or inhibitor of CYP3A4 should be avoided in general.
Coadministration of phenytoin with a dose bioequivalent to 34 mg Nisoldipine tablets in epileptic patients lowered the nisoldipine plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of Nisoldipine with phenytoin should be avoided and alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered. Pharmacokinetic interactions between nisoldipine and beta-blockers (atenolol, propranolol) were variable and not significant. Propranolol attenuated the heart rate increase following administration of immediate release nisoldipine. The blood pressure effect of Nisoldipine tended to be greater in patients on atenolol than in patients on no other antihypertensive therapy. Quinidine at 648 mg bid decreased the bioavailability (AUC) of nisoldipine by 26%, but not the peak concentration. Immediate release nisoldipine increased plasma quinidine concentrations by about 20%. This interaction was not accompanied by ECG changes and its clinical significance is not known. No significant interactions were found between nisoldipine and warfarin or digoxin.","cimetidine, ranitidine, phenytoin, atenolol, propranolol, quinidine, warfarin, digoxin"

(150 mg and 300 mg)

Rx Only",DI,"Drug Interactions

Ranitidine Tablets have been reported to affect the bioavailability of other drugs through several different mechanisms such as competition for renal tubular secretion, alteration of gastric pH, and inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes.


Procainamide:
 Ranitidine, a substrate of the renal organic cation transport system, may affect the clearance of other drugs eliminated by this route. High doses of ranitidine (e.g., such as those used in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) have been shown to reduce the renal excretion of procainamide and N-acetylprocainamide resulting in increased plasma levels of these drugs. Although this interaction is unlikely to be clinically relevant at usual ranitidine doses, it may be prudent to monitor for procainamide toxicity when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose exceeding 300 mg per day. 


Warfarin:
 There have been reports of altered prothrombin time among patients on concomitant warfarin and ranitidine therapy. Due to the narrow therapeutic index, close monitoring of increased or decreased prothrombin time is recommended during concurrent treatment with ranitidine. 
Ranitidine may alter the absorption of drugs in which gastric pH is an important determinant of bioavailability. This can result in either an increase in absorption (e.g., triazolam, midazolam, glipizide) or a decrease in absorption (e.g., ketoconazole, atazanavir, delavirdine, gefitinib). Appropriate clinical monitoring is recommended. 


Atazanavir:
 Atazanavir absorption may be impaired based on known interactions with other agents that increase gastric pH. Use with caution. See atazanavir label for specific recommendations. 


Delavirdine:
 Delavirdine absorption may be impaired based on known interactions with other agents that increase gastric pH. Chronic use of H2-receptor antagonists with delavirdine is not recommended. 


Gefitinib:
 Gefitinib exposure was reduced by 44% with the co-administration of ranitidine and sodium bicarbonate (dosed to maintain gastric pH above 5.0). Use with caution. 


Glipizide:
 In diabetic patients, glipizide exposure was increased by 34% following a single 150-mg dose of oral ranitidine. Use appropriate clinical monitoring when initiating or discontinuing ranitidine.


Ketoconazole:
 Oral ketoconazole exposure was reduced by up to 95% when oral ranitidine was co-administered in a regimen to maintain a gastric pH of 6 or above. The degree of interaction with usual dose of ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) is unknown. 


Midazolam:
 Oral midazolam exposure in 5 healthy volunteers was increased by up to 65% when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. However, in another interaction study in 8 volunteers receiving IV midazolam, a 300 mg oral dose of ranitidine increased midazolam exposure by about 9%. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation when ranitidine is co-administered with oral midazolam. 


Triazolam:
 Triazolam exposure in healthy volunteers was increased by approximately 30% when administered with oral ranitidine at a dose of 150 mg twice daily. Monitor patients for excessive or prolonged sedation.","Procainamide, N-acetylprocainamide, warfarin, triazolam, midazolam, glipizide, ketoconazole, atazanavir, delavirdine, gefitinib"

RITONAVIR tablets, for oral use
 

Initial U.S. Approval: 1996",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

When co-administering ritonavir with other protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, saquinavir, and tipranavir), see the full prescribing information for that protease inhibitor including important information for drug interactions. 






Co-administration of ritonavir can alter the concentrations of other drugs. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4,
 5.1, 
7, 
12.3)









7.1 Potential for Ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

Ritonavir is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Agents that are extensively metabolized by CYP3A and have high first pass metabolism appear to be the most susceptible to large increases in AUC (greater than 3-fold) when co-administered with ritonavir. Thus, co-administration of ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Co-administration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 4. 
Ritonavir also inhibits CYP2D6 to a lesser extent. Co-administration of substrates of CYP2D6 with ritonavir could result in increases (up to 2-fold) in the AUC of the other agent, possibly requiring a proportional dosage reduction. Ritonavir also appears to induce CYP3A, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6 as well as other enzymes, including glucuronosyl transferase. 
These examples are a guide and not considered a comprehensive list of all possible drugs that may interact with ritonavir. The healthcare provider should consult appropriate references for comprehensive information.








7.2 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Altered Pharmacokinetics of Quinidine



Drugs that alkalinize the urine (carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics) reduce renal elimination of quinidine.
By pharmacokinetic mechanisms that are not well understood, quinidine levels are increased by coadministration of amiodarone or cimetidine. Very rarely, and again by mechanisms not understood, quinidine levels are decreased by coadministration of nifedipine.
Hepatic elimination of quinidine may be accelerated by coadministration of drugs (phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin) that induce production of cytochrome P450IIIA4.
Perhaps because of competition for the P450IIIA4 metabolic pathway, quinidine levels rise when ketaconazole is coadministered.
Coadministration of propranolol usually does not affect quinidine pharmacokinetics, but in some studies the β-blocker appeared to cause increases in the peak serum levels of quinidine, decreases in quinidine’s volume of distribution, and decreases in total quinidine clearance. The effects (if any) of coadministration of other β-blockers on quinidine pharmacokinetics have not been adequately studied.
Diltiazem significantly decreases the clearance and increases the t1/2 of quinidine, but quinidine does not alter the kinetics of diltiazem. Hepatic clearance of quinidine is significantly reduced during coadministration of verapamil, with corresponding increases in serum levels and half-life.










Altered Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs



Quinidine slows the elimination of digoxin and simultaneously reduces digoxin’s apparent volume of distribution. As a result, serum digoxin levels may be as much as doubled. When quinidine and digoxin are coadministered, digoxin doses usually need to be reduced. Serum levels of digoxin are also raised when quinidine is coadministered, although the effect appears to be smaller.
By a mechanism that is not understood, quinidine potentiates the anticoagulatory action of warfarin, and the anticoagulant dosage may need to be reduced. Cytochrome P450IID6 is an enzyme critical to the metabolism of many drugs, notably including mexiletine, some phenothiazines, and most polycyclic antidepressants. Constitutional deficiency of cytochrome P450IID6 is found in less than 1% of Orientals, in about 2% of American blacks, and in about 8% of American whites. Testing with debrisoquine is sometimes used to distinguish the P450IID6-deficient “poor metabolizers” from the majority-pheno-type “extensive metabolizers”.
When drugs whose metabolism is P450IID6-dependent are given to poor metabolizers, the serum levels achieved are higher, sometimes much higher, than the serum levels achieved when identical doses are given to extensive metabolizers. To obtain similar clinical benefit without toxicity, doses given to poor metabolizers may need to be greatly reduced. In the cases of prodrugs whose actions are actually mediated by P450IID6-produced metabolites (for example, codeine and hydrocodone, whose analgesic and antitussive effects appear to be mediated by morphine and hydromorphone, respectively), it may not be possible to achieve the desired clinical benefits in poor metabolizers.
Quinidine is not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6, but therapeutic serum levels of quinidine inhibit the action of cytochrome P450IID6, effectively converting extensive metabolizers into poor metabolizers. Caution must be exercised whenever quinidine is prescribed together with drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6.
Perhaps by competing for pathways of renal clearance, coadministration of quinidine causes an increase in serum levels of procainamide.
Serum levels of haloperidol are increased when quinidine is coadministered.
Presumably because both drugs are metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6, coadministration of quinidine causes variable slowing of the metabolism of nifedipine. Interactions with other dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers have not been reported, but these agents (including felodipine, nicardipine, and nimodipine) are all dependent upon P450IIIA4 for metabolism, so similar interactions with quinidine should be anticipated.










Altered Pharmacodynamics of Other Drugs



Quinidine’s anitcholinergic, vasodilating, and negative inotropic actions may be additive to those of other drugs with these effects, and antagonistic to those of drugs with cholinergic, vasoconstricting, and positive inotropic effects. For example, when quinidine and verapamil are coadministered in doses that are each well tolerated as monotherapy, hypotension attributable to additive peripheral α-blockade is sometimes reported.
Quinidine potentiates the actions of depolarizing (succinylcholine, decamethonium) and nondepolarizing (d-tubocurarine, pancuronium) neuromuscular blocking agents. These phenomena are not well understood, but they are observed in animal models as well as in humans. In addition, in vitro addition of quinidine to the serum of pregnant women reduces the activity of pseudocholinesterase, an enzyme that is essential to the metabolism of succinylcholine.










Non-Interactions of Quinidine With Other Drugs



Quinidine has no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem, flecainide, mephenytoin, metoprolol, propafenone, propranolol, quinine, timolol, or tocainide.
Conversely, the pharmacokinetics of quinidine are not significantly affected by caffeine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, diltiazem, felodipine, omeprazole, or quinine. Quinidine’s pharmacokinetics are also unaffected by cigarette smoking.","carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, thiazide diuretics, amiodarone, cimetidine, nifedipine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampin, ketaconazole, propranolol, diltiazem, verapamil, digoxin, warfarin, mexiletine, phenothiazines, polycyclic antidepressants, debrisoquine, codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, hydromorphone, procainamide, haloperidol, felodipine, nicardipine, nimodipine, succinylcholine, decamethonium, d-tubocurarine, pancuronium, flecainide, mephenytoin, metoprolol, propafenone, quinine, timolol, tocainide, caffeine, ciprofloxacin, omeprazole"

XADAGO is contraindicated for use with other drugs in the MAOIs class or other drugs that are potent inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (e.g., linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial, which also has reversible nonselective MAO inhibition activity). Co-administration increases the risk of nonselective MAO inhibition, which may lead to hypertensive crisis

Isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity.  Monitor for hypertension and reaction to dietary tyramine in patients treated concomitantly with isoniazid and XADAGO.








7.2	Opioid Drugs

Because serious, sometimes fatal reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use of opioid drugs (e.g., meperidine and its derivatives, methadone, propoxyphene, or tramadol) and MAOIs, including selective MAO-B inhibitors, concomitant use of these drugs is contraindicated 
         
 
  [see

7.4	Dextromethorphan

The combination of MAOIs and dextromethorphan has been reported to cause episodes of psychosis or bizarre behavior. Therefore, in view of XADAGO's MAO inhibitory activity, dextromethorphan is contraindicated for use with XADAGO.








7.5	Sympathomimetic Medications

Severe hypertensive reactions have followed the administration of sympathomimetics and nonselective MAOIs. Hypertensive crisis has been reported in patients taking the recommended doses of selective MAO-B inhibitors and sympathomimetic medications.

7.6	Tyramine

MAO in the gastrointestinal tract and liver (primarily type A) provides protection from exogenous amines (e.g., tyramine).  If tyramine were absorbed intact, it could lead to severe hypertension, including hypertensive crisis. Aged, fermented, cured, smoked, and pickled foods containing large amounts of exogenous amines (e.g., aged cheese, pickled herring) may cause release of norepinephrine resulting in a rise in blood pressure (Tyramine Reaction). Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a large amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of XADAGO

When protriptyline is given with anticholinergic agents or sympathomimetic drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics, close supervision and careful adjustment of dosages are required.
Hyperpyrexia has been reported when tricyclic antidepressants are administered with anticholinergic agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency and severity of side-effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when cimetidine was added to the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.

Effects of Drugs and Other Substances on Quinine Pharmacokinetics





Antacids 


Antacids containing aluminum and/or magnesium may delay or decrease absorption of quinine. 


Concomitant administration of these antacids with quinine sulfate should be avoided. 




Antiepileptics (AEDs) (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin) 


Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are CYP3A4 inducers and may decrease quinine plasma concentrations if used concurrently with quinine sulfate. 


If concomitant administration with carbamazepine or phenobarbital cannot be avoided, frequent monitoring of anticonvulsant drug concentrations is recommended. Additionally, patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with these anticonvulsants. 




Histamine H2-receptor blockers [cimetidine, ranitidine (nonspecific CYP450 inhibitors)]


When quinine is to be given concomitantly with a histamine  H2-receptor blocker, the use of ranitidine is preferred over cimetidine. Although cimetidine and ranitidine may be used concomitantly with quinine sulfate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Patients should be monitored closely for adverse events associated with quinine. 




Ketoconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) 


No change in the quinine sulfate dosage regimen is necessary with concomitant ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with quinine. 




Macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, troleandomycin) (CYP3A4 inhibitors) 


Increased quinine plasma levels have been observed when used concomitantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Concomitant administration of macrolide antibiotics such as erythromycin or troleandomycin with quinine sulfate should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 




Rifampin (CYP3A4 inducer) 


Decreased quinine plasma levels have been observed when used concomitantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Concomitant administration of rifampin with quinine sulfate should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 




Ritonavir 


Increased quinine plasma levels have been observed when used concomitantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Concomitant administration of ritonavir with quinine sulfate should be avoided. 




Tetracycline 


Tetracycline may be concomitantly administered with quinine sulfate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with quinine sulfate. 




Theophylline or aminophylline 


No change in the quinine sulfate dosage regimen is necessary with concomitant theophylline or aminophylline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with quinine. 




Urinary alkalizers (acetazolamide, sodium bicarbonate) 


Urinary alkalinizing agents may increase plasma quinine concentrations. 


Use caution if using concomitantly. 





Effects of Quinine on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs





Anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, 
phenobarbital, and phenytoin) 


Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin are CYP3A4 inducers and may decrease quinine plasma concentrations if used concurrently with quinine sulfate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


If concomitant administration with carbamazepine or phenobarbital cannot be avoided, frequent monitoring of anticonvulsant drug concentrations is recommended. Patients should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with these anticonvulsants. 




Astemizole (CYP3A4 substrate) 


Elevated plasma astemizole concentrations were reported in a subject who experienced torsades de pointes after receiving three doses of quinine sulfate for nocturnal leg cramps concomitantly with chronic astemizole 10 mg/day. 


The concurrent use of quinine sulfate with astemizole and other CYP3A4 substrates with QT prolongation potential (e.g., cisapride, terfenadine, halofantrine, pimozide and quinidine) should also be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 




Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 


Rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria was reported in a patient taking atorvastatin administered with a single dose of quinine. Quinine may increase plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, thereby increasing the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Thus, clinicians considering combined therapy of quinine sulfate with atorvastatin or other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (“statins”) that are CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., simvastatin, lovastatin) should carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks of each medication. If quinine sulfate is used concomitantly with any of these statins, lower starting and maintenance doses of the statin should be considered. 


Patients should also be monitored closely for any signs or symptoms of muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness, particularly during initial therapy. If marked creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation occurs or myopathy (defined as muscle aches or muscle weakness in conjunction with CPK values > 10 times the upper limit of normal) is diagnosed or suspected, atorvastatin or other statin should be discontinued. 




Desipramine (CYP2D6 substrate) 


Quinine may inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates if used at antimalarial doses (greater than or equal to 600 mg) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Patients taking medications that are CYP2D6 substrates with quinine sulfate should be monitored closely for adverse reactions associated with these medications. 




Digoxin (P-gp substrate) 


Digoxin levels may be increased with use of quinine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


If quinine sulfate is administered to patients receiving digoxin, plasma digoxin concentrations should be closely monitored, and the digoxin dose adjusted, as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. 




Mefloquine 


The concomitant administration of mefloquine and quinine sulfate may produce electrocardiographic abnormalities (including QTc prolongation) and may increase the risk of seizures [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Avoid concomitant use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 




Neuromuscular blocking agents (pancuronium, succinylcholine, tubocurarine) 


Quinine may also enhance the neuromuscular blocking effects of succinylcholine and tubocurarine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Avoid concomitant use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. 




Ritonavir 


Ritonavir has significant effect on quinine pharmacokinetics [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


The concomitant administration of quinine sulfate with ritonavir should be avoided. 




Theophylline or aminophylline (CYP1A2 substrate) 


Increased quinine plasma levels when used concomitantly [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


If quinine sulfate is co-administered to patients receiving theophylline or aminophylline, plasma theophylline concentrations should be monitored frequently to ensure therapeutic concentrations. 




Warfarin and oral anticoagulants 


Cinchona alkaloids, including quinine, may have the potential to depress hepatic enzyme synthesis of vitamin K-dependent coagulation pathway proteins and may enhance the action of warfarin and other oral anticoagulants. Quinine may also interfere with the anticoagulant effect of heparin. 


In patients receiving these anticoagulants, the prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), or international normalization ratio (INR) should be closely monitored as appropriate, during concurrent therapy with quinine sulfate. 




Drug/Laboratory Interactions 


Quinine may produce an elevated value for urinary 17-ketogenic steroids when the Zimmerman method is used. Quinine may interfere with urine qualitative dipstick protein assays as well as quantitative methods (e.g., pyrogallol red-molybdate). 


Special attention to patients using quinine is needed to minimize errors in the interpretation of laboratory results.

7.1 Use of Other Antiretroviral Drugs after Discontinuation of APRETUDE

Residual concentrations of cabotegravir may remain in the systemic circulation of individuals for prolonged periods (up to 12 months or longer). These residual concentrations are not expected to affect the exposures of antiretroviral drugs that are initiated after discontinuation of APRETUDE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3), Drug Interactions (7.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect APRETUDE 

Cabotegravir is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1 with some contribution from UGT1A9. Drugs that are strong inducers of UGT1A1 or 1A9 are expected to decrease cabotegravir plasma concentrations; therefore, coadministration of APRETUDE with these drugs is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

Allopurinol and NIPENT are both associated with skin rashes. Based on clinical studies in 25 refractory patients who received both NIPENT and allopurinol, the combined use of NIPENT and allopurinol did not appear to produce a higher incidence of skin rashes than observed with NIPENT alone. There has been a report of one patient who received both drugs and experienced a hypersensitivity vasculitis that resulted in death. It was unclear whether this adverse event and subsequent death resulted from the drug combination.
Biochemical studies have demonstrated that pentostatin enhances the effects of vidarabine, a purine nucleoside with antiviral activity. The combined use of vidarabine and NIPENT may result in an increase in adverse reactions associated with each drug. The therapeutic benefit of the drug combination has not been established. 
The combined use of NIPENT and fludarabine phosphate is not recommended because it may be associated with an increased risk of fatal pulmonary toxicity (see 
WARNINGS
).
Acute pulmonary edema and hypotension, leading to death, have been reported in the literature in patients treated with pentostatin in combination with carmustine, etoposide and high dose cyclophosphamide as part of the ablative regimen for bone marrow transplant.","Allopurinol,vidarabine,fludarabine phosphate,carmustine,etoposide,cyclophosphamide"

Table 8 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with HUMATROPE and instructions for preventing or managing them.


Table 8: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with HUMATROPE






Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment




Clinical Impact:

Microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. HUMATROPE inhibits 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of HUMATROPE may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations.




Intervention:

Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of HUMATROPE [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].




Examples:

Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be effected more than others since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.




Non-Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment in Pediatric Patients




Clinical Impact:

Non-replacement glucocorticoid treatment, including supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment, may attenuate the growth promoting effects of HUMATROPE in pediatric patients.




Intervention:

Carefully adjust glucocorticoid dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth.




Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs




Clinical Impact:

Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. HUMATROPE may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes.




Intervention:

Careful monitoring is advisable when HUMATROPE is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CP450 liver enzymes.




Oral Estrogen




Clinical Impact:

Oral estrogens may reduce the serum IGF-1 response to HUMATROPE.




Intervention:

Patients receiving oral estrogen may require greater HUMATROPE dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].




Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents




Clinical Impact:

Treatment with HUMATROPE may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses.




Intervention:

Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].











Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment: Patients treated with glucocorticoids for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of HUMATROPE. (7)


Non-Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment in Pediatric Patients: Adjust glucocorticoid dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatment to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. (7)


Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: HUMATROPE may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with HUMATROPE. (7)


Oral Estrogen: Patients may require larger doses of HUMATROPE. (7)


Insulin and/or Other Hypoglycemic Agents: Dose adjustment of insulin or hypoglycemic agent may be required. (5.4, 7)","Cortisone acetate, prednisone, antipyrine, oral estrogen, insulin"

  HYDROCODONE BITARTRATE  extended-release capsules, for oral use, CII Initial U.S. Approval: 1943",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS







Alcohol






Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of alcohol with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules can result in an increase of hydrocodone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of hydrocodone.



Intervention:

Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 



Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of hydrocodone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to hydrocodone. 



Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients at frequent intervals for respiratory depression and sedation. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal.



Examples:

Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)



CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of hydrocodone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to hydrocodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the hydrocodone plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.



Examples:

Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin



Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants




Clinical Impact:

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.



Intervention:

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].



Examples:

Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.



Serotonergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.




Intervention:

If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



Examples:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)




Clinical Impact:

MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Drug Interactions (7)].



Intervention:

The use of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



Examples:

Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid



Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics




Clinical Impact:

May reduce the analgesic effect of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use.



Examples:

butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine



Muscle Relaxants




Clinical Impact:

Hydrocodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.



Intervention:

Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].



Diuretics




Clinical Impact:

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



Anticholinergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.










Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7)

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate the effects of hydrocodone. Avoid concomitant use in patients receiving MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping an MAOI. (7)

Mixed Agonists/Antagonists and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules because they may reduce analgesic effect of hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release capsules or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with OLINVYK.

Table 6:	Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with OLINVYK





Moderate to Strong Inhibitors of CYP2D6



Clinical Impact:
Concomitant administration of a moderate to strong CYP2D6 inhibitor can increase the plasma concentration of oliceridine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects.


Intervention:
If concomitant use is necessary, patients taking a moderate to strong CYP2D6 inhibitor may require less frequent dosing of OLINVYK.  Monitor closely for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and base subsequent doses on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment.
            If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.


Examples:
Paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion



Moderate to Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4



Clinical Impact:

The concomitant administration of moderate to strong CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of oliceridine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid adverse reactions.
            After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the oliceridine concentration may decrease, resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to oliceridine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].


Intervention:

Caution should be used when administering OLINVYK to patients taking inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme. If concomitant use is necessary, patients taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor may require less frequent dosing. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.
            If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.


Examples:
Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir).



Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitors and CYP2D6 Inhibitors




Clinical Impact:
OLINVYK is primarily metabolized by both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Compared to inhibition of either metabolic pathway, inhibition of both pathways can result in a greater increase of the plasma concentrations of oliceridine and prolong opioid adverse reactions [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Intervention:
Patients who are CYP2D6 normal metabolizers taking a CYP2D6 inhibitor, and a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) may require less frequent dosing. 
            Patients who are known CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking a CYP3A4 inhibitor (or discontinuation of CYP3A4 inducers) may require less frequent dosing. 
            These patients should be closely monitored for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals, and subsequent doses should be based on the patient’s severity of pain and response to treatment.


Examples:
Inhibitors of CYP3A4: Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole), anti-retroviral agents, selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), NS3/4A inhibitors.
            Inhibitors of CYP2D6: Paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine, bupropion




Inducers of CYP3A4



Clinical Impact:
The concomitant use of OLINVYK and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of oliceridine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to oliceridine. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].
            After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oliceridine plasma concentration may increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.


Intervention:
If concomitant use with CYP3A4 inducer is necessary, increase of the OLINVYK dosage may be considered until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.
            If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider OLINVYK dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.


Examples:
Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin



Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants



Clinical Impact:
Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].


Intervention:
Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].


Examples:
Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol



Serotonergic Drugs



Clinical Impact:
The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.


Intervention:
If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue OLINVYK if serotonin syndrome is suspected.


Examples:
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs,) serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics



Clinical Impact:
May reduce the analgesic effect of OLINVYK and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.


Intervention:
Avoid concomitant use.


Examples:
butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine



Muscle Relaxants



Clinical Impact:
OLINVYK may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.


Intervention:
Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of OLINVYK and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.



Diuretics



Clinical Impact:
Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.


Intervention:
Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



Anticholinergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:
The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.


Intervention:
Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when OLINVYK is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.









Moderate and Strong CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Patients may require less frequent dosing. Monitor closely and administer subsequent doses based on severity of pain and patient response. (5.6, 7)

Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome.  Discontinue OLINVYK if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7)

Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with OLINVYK because they may reduce analgesic effect of OLINVYK or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Initial U.S. Approval: 1996",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Fosphenytoin is extensively bound to human plasma proteins. Drugs highly bound to albumin could increase the unbound fraction of fosphenytoin. Although, it is unknown whether this could result in clinically significant effects, caution is advised when administering fosphenytoin sodium with other drugs that significantly bind to serum albumin. The most significant drug interactions following administration of fosphenytoin sodium are expected to occur with drugs that interact with phenytoin. Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. 
Phenytoin or fosphenytoin sodium is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes.

7.1 Meperidine

Serious, sometimes fatal reactions have been precipitated with concomitant use of meperidine (e.g., Demerol and other trade names) and MAO inhibitors including selective MAO-B inhibitors [see Contraindications (4)].









7.2 Dextromethorphan

The concomitant use of rasagiline and dextromethorphan was not allowed in clinical studies. The combination of MAO inhibitors and dextromethorphan has been reported to cause brief episodes of psychosis or bizarre behavior. Therefore, in view of rasagiline’s MAO inhibitory activity, dextromethorphan is contraindicated for use with rasagiline [see Contraindications (4)].









7.3 MAO Inhibitors

Rasagiline is contraindicated for use with other MAO inhibitors because of the increased risk of nonselective MAO inhibition that may lead to a hypertensive crisis [see Contraindications (4)].









7.4 Sympathomimetic Medications

The concomitant use of rasagiline and sympathomimetic medications was not allowed in clinical studies. Severe hypertensive reactions have followed the administration of sympathomimetics and nonselective MAO inhibitors. Hypertensive crisis has been reported in patients taking the recommended dose of rasagiline and sympathomimetic medications. Severe hypertension has been reported in patients taking the recommended dose of rasagiline and ophthalmic drops containing sympathomimetic medications.Because rasagiline is a selective MAOI, hypertensive reactions are not ordinarily expected with the concomitant use of sympathomimetic medications. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised when concomitantly using recommended doses of rasagiline with any sympathomimetic medications including nasal, oral, and ophthalmic decongestants and cold remedies.








7.5 Antidepressants

Concomitant use of rasagiline with one of many classes of antidepressants (e.g., SSRIs, SNRIs, triazolopyridine, tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants) is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of rasagiline and MAO inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].









7.6 Ciprofloxacin or Other CYP1A2 Inhibitors

Rasagiline plasma concentrations may increase up to 2 fold in patients using concomitant ciprofloxacin and other CYP1A2 inhibitors. This could result in increased adverse events. Patients taking concomitant ciprofloxacin or other CYP1A2 inhibitors should not exceed a dose of rasagiline 0.5 mg once daily [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.7 Tyramine/Rasagiline Interaction

MAO in the gastrointestinal tract and liver (primarily type A) provides protection from exogenous amines (e.g., tyramine) that have the capacity, if absorbed intact, to cause a tyramine reaction with hypertension including clinical syndromes referred to as hypertensive urgency, crisis, or emergency. Foods and medications containing large amounts of exogenous amines (e.g., from fermented cheese, herring, over-the-counter cough/cold medications) may cause release of norepinephrine resulting in a rise in systemic blood pressure.Results of a special tyramine challenge study indicate that rasagiline is selective for MAO-B at recommended doses and can be used without dietary tyramine restriction. However, certain foods may contain very high amounts (i.e., 150 mg or greater) of tyramine and could potentially cause a hypertensive reaction in individual patients taking rasagiline due to increased sensitivity to tyramine. Selectivity for inhibiting MAO-B diminishes in a dose-related manner as the dose is progressively increased above the recommended daily doses.There were no cases of hypertensive crisis in the clinical development program associated with 1 mg daily rasagiline treatment, in which most patients did not follow dietary tyramine restriction.There have been postmarketing reports of patients who experienced significantly elevated blood pressure (including rare cases of hypertensive crisis) after ingestion of unknown amounts of tyramine-rich foods while taking recommended doses of rasagiline. Patients should be advised to avoid foods containing a very large amount of tyramine while taking recommended doses of rasagiline [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

7.2	Quinolone Antibiotics

Co-administration of LANTHANUM CARBONATE with quinolone antibiotics may reduce the extent of their absorption. The bioavailability of oral ciprofloxacin was decreased by approximately 50% when taken with LANTHANUM CARBONATE in a single-dose study in healthy volunteers. Administer oral quinolone antibiotics at least 1 hour before or 4 hours after LANTHANUM CARBONATE. When oral quinolones are given for short courses, consider eliminating the doses of LANTHANUM CARBONATE that would normally be scheduled near the time of quinolone intake to improve quinolone absorption [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3	Levothyroxine

The bioavailability of levothyroxine was decreased by approximately 40% when taken together with LANTHANUM CARBONATE. Administer thyroid hormone replacement therapy at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after dosing with LANTHANUM CARBONATE and monitor thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.4	Use with Other Oral Medications

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between LANTHANUM CARBONATE and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medications where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy, consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs. The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Consider monitoring clinical responses or blood levels of concomitant medications that have a narrow therapeutic range.","aluminum, magnesium, calcium, quinolones, ampicillin, tetracyclines, thyroid hormones, ACE inhibitors, statin lipid regulators, anti-malarials, ciprofloxacin, levothyroxine"

Griseofulvin has been reported in the literature to interfere with the metabolism of various compounds. Whether this is due to a P-450 mediated enzyme induction effects on sulfurtransferase and/or glucotransferase activity, or some other mechanism is unknown.
Griseofulvin decreases the activity of warfarin-type anticoagulants, so that patients receiving these drugs concomitantly may require dosage adjustment of the anticoagulant during and after griseofulvin therapy.
Griseofulvin may enhance the hepatic metabolism of estrogens, including the estrogen component of oral contraceptives, thereby reducing the effectiveness of contraception and causing menstrual irregularities. Therefore, an alternate or second form of birth control may be indicated during periods of concurrent use (see also
 
  
CONTRAINDICATIONS
).

 
Cyclosporine levels may be reduced when administered concomitantly with griseofulvin, resulting in a decrease in the pharmacologic effects of cyclosporine.
Serum salicylate concentrations may be decreased when griseofulvin is given concomitantly with salicylates.
Barbiturates usually depress griseofulvin activity by decreasing plasma levels and concomitant administration may require a dosage adjustment of the antifungal agent.

•Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, cimetidine)





•Clinically significant increases in naloxegol concentrations are not expected.





•No dosage adjustments are necessary. 







•Grapefruit or grapefruit juiceThe effect of grapefruit juice varies widely among brands and is concentration-, dose-, and preparation-dependent. Studies have shown that it can be classified as a “strong CYP3A inhibitor” when a certain preparation was used (e.g., high dose, double strength) or as a “moderate CYP3A inhibitor” when another preparation was used (e.g., low dose, single strength).






•Can increase plasma naloxegol concentrations.

7.1 Effect of Cytochrome CYP3A Inhibitors and Inducers


In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa is metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 to its active metabolite TEPA. Avoid coadministration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir) and strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin) with thiotepa due to the potential effects on efficacy and toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider alternative medications with no or minimal potential to inhibit or induce CYP3A4. If concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 modulators cannot be avoided, closely monitor for adverse drug reactions.








7.2 Effect of Thiotepa on Cytochrome CYP2B6 Substrates


In vitro studies suggest that thiotepa inhibits CYP2B6. Thiotepa may increase the exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP2B6 in patients; however, the clinical relevance of this in vitro interaction is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].
The administration of thiotepa with cyclophosphamide in patients reduces the conversion of cyclophosphamide to the active metabolite, 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide; the effect appears sequence dependent with a greater reduction in the conversion to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide when thiotepa is administered 1.5 hours prior to the intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide compared to administration of thiotepa after intravenous cyclophosphamide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

The plasma concentration of CMI has been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of haloperidol; plasma levels of several closely related tricyclic antidepressants have been reported to be increased by the concomitant administration of methylphenidate or hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decreased by the concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and such an effect may be anticipated with CMI as well. Administration of CMI has been reported to increase the plasma levels of phenobarbital, if given concomitantly (see 

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Interactions
).

Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6 – The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so-called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA). In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. Fluvoxamine has also been shown to inhibit P450 1A2, an isoform also involved in TCA metabolism. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary). Concomitant use of agents in the tricyclic antidepressant class (which includes clomipramine hydrochloride) with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant agent or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant agent may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever an agent of the tricyclic antidepressant class including clomipramine hydrochloride is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6 (and/or P450 1A2).
Because clomipramine hydrochloride is highly bound to serum protein, the administration of clomipramine hydrochloride to patients taking other drugs that are highly bound to protein (e.g., warfarin, digoxin) may cause an increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs, potentially resulting in adverse effects. Conversely, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound clomipramine hydrochloride by other highly bound drugs (see

7.2 	PDE3 Inhibitors

AGRYLIN is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor. Avoid use of drug products with similar properties such as inotropes and other PDE3 inhibitors (e.g., cilostazol, milrinone) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].








7.3 	Aspirin and Drugs that Increase Bleeding Risk

Co-administration of single-dose or repeat-dose AGRYLIN and aspirin showed greater ex vivo anti-platelet aggregation effects than administration of aspirin alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Results from an observational study in patients with essential thrombocythemia suggest the rate of major hemorrhagic events (MHEs) in patients treated with AGRYLIN is higher than in those subjects treated with another cytoreductive treatment. The majority of the major hemorrhagic events occurred in patients who were also receiving concomitant anti-aggregatory treatment (primarily, aspirin). Therefore, the potential risks of the concomitant use of AGRYLIN with aspirin should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high-risk profile for hemorrhage, before treatment is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Monitor patients for bleeding, particularly those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors).








7.4 	CYP450 Interactions







CYP1A2 inhibitors: AGRYLIN and its active metabolite are primarily metabolized by CYP1A2. Drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin) could increase the exposure of AGRYLIN. Monitor patients for cardiovascular events and titrate doses accordingly when CYP1A2 inhibitors are co-administered.










CYP1A2 inducers: CYP1A2 inducers could decrease the exposure of AGRYLIN. Patients taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers (e.g., omeprazole) may need to have their dose titrated to compensate for the decrease in AGRYLIN exposure.










CYP1A2 substrates: AGRYLIN demonstrates limited inhibitory activity towards CYP1A2 in vitro and may alter the exposure of concomitant CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, fluvoxamine, ondansetron).","chloroquine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, moxifloxacin, amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, pimozide, cilostazol, milrinone, aspirin, anticoagulants, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, omeprazole, theophylline, ondansetron"

Drugs or herbal products that induce certain enzymes, such as CYP3A4, may decrease the effectiveness of progestin-only pills. (7) 








Drugs or herbal products that induce enzymes, including CYP3A4, that metabolize progestins may decrease the plasma concentrations of progestins, and may decrease the effectiveness of progestin-only pills.

In evaluating the potential for interactions among co-administered antiepilepsy drugs (AEDs), whether or not an AED induces or does not induce metabolic enzymes is an important consideration. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital are generally classified as enzyme inducers; valproate and gabapentin are not. Tiagabine HCl is considered to be a non-enzyme inducing AED (see 
PRECAUTIONS, General, Use in Non-Induced Patients
).

 

The drug interaction data described in this section were obtained from studies involving either healthy subjects or patients with epilepsy. 

Effects of Tiagabine HCl on other Antiepilepsy Drugs (AEDs) 


Phenytoin: Tiagabine had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy. 

Carbamazepine: Tiagabine had no effect on the steady-state plasma concentrations of carbamazepine or its epoxide metabolite in patients with epilepsy. 

Valproate: Tiagabine causes a slight decrease (about 10%) in steady-state valproate concentrations. 

Phenobarbital or Primidone: No formal pharmacokinetic studies have been performed examining the addition of tiagabine to regimens containing phenobarbital or primidone. The addition of tiagabine in a limited number of patients in three well-controlled studies caused no systematic changes in phenobarbital or primidone concentrations when compared to placebo. 

Effects of other Antiepilepsy Drugs (AEDs) on Tiagabine HCl 


Carbamazepine: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking carbamazepine with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs. 

Phenytoin: Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking phenytoin with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs. 

Phenobarbital (Primidone): Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that tiagabine clearance is 60% greater in patients taking phenobarbital (primidone) with or without other enzyme-inducing AEDs. 

Valproate: The addition of tiagabine to patients taking valproate chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics, but valproate significantly decreased tiagabine binding in vitro from 
96.3% to 94.8%, which resulted in an increase of approximately 40% in the free tiagabine concentration. The clinical relevance of this in vitro finding is unknown.  

Interaction of Tiagabine HCl with Other Drugs 


Cimetidine: Co-administration of cimetidine (800 mg/day) to patients taking tiagabine chronically had no effect on tiagabine pharmacokinetics. 

Theophylline: A single 10 mg dose of tiagabine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline at steady- state. 

Warfarin: No significant differences were observed in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin or S-warfarin with the addition of tiagabine given as a single dose. Prothrombin times were not affected by tiagabine. 

Digoxin: Concomitant administration of tiagabine did not affect the steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of digoxin or the mean daily trough serum level of digoxin. 

Ethanol or Triazolam: No significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetics of triazolam (0.125 mg) and tiagabine (10 mg) when given together as a single dose. The pharmacokinetics of ethanol were not affected by multiple-dose administration of tiagabine. Tiagabine has shown no clinically important potentiation of the pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam or alcohol. Because of the possible additive effects of drugs that may depress the nervous system, ethanol or triazolam should be used cautiously in combination with tiagabine. 

Oral Contraceptives: Multiple dose administration of tiagabine (8 mg/day monotherapy) did not 
alter the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives in healthy women of child-bearing age. 

Antipyrine: Antipyrine pharmacokinetics were not significantly different before and after tiagabine multiple-dose regimens. This indicates that tiagabine does not cause induction or inhibition of the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems responsible for the metabolism of antipyrine. 

St. John’s wort: Concomitant use of St. John’s wort may enhance the metabolism of tiagabine. 




Interaction of Tiagabine HCl with Highly Protein Bound Drugs 


In vitro data showed that tiagabine is 96% bound to human plasma protein and therefore has the potential to interact with other highly protein bound compounds. Such an interaction can potentially lead to higher free fractions of either tiagabine or the competing drug.","Carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, phenobarbital, valproate, gabapentin, cimetidine, theophylline, warfarin, digoxin, ethanol, triazolam, oral contraceptives, antipyrine, St. John’s wort"

• 
    Allopurinol: Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets when coadministered with allopurinol. (2.4, 7.1)
    
• 
    Warfarin: Mercaptopurine Tablets may decrease the anticoagulant effect. (7.2)
   








7.1 Allopurinol


Allopurinol can inhibit the first-pass oxidative metabolism of mercaptopurine by xanthine oxidase, which can lead to an increased risk of mercaptopurine adverse reactions (i.e., myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting)
   [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Reduce the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets when coadministered with allopurinol 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].










7.2 Warfarin


The concomitant administration ofMercaptopurine Tablets and warfarin may decrease the anticoagulant effectiveness of warfarin. Monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) in patients receiving warfarin and adjust the warfarin dosage as appropriate.









7.3 Myelosuppressive Products


Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause myelosuppression. Myelosuppression may be increased when Mercaptopurine Tablets is coadministered with other products that cause myelosuppression. Enhanced myelosuppression has been noted in some patients also receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Monitor the CBC and adjust the dose of Mercaptopurine Tablets for excessive myelosuppression
   [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].










7.4 Aminosalicylates


Aminosalicylates (e.g., mesalamine, olsalazine or sulfasalazine) may inhibit the TPMT enzyme, which may increase the risk of myelosuppression when coadministered with Mercaptopurine Tablets. When aminosalicylates and Mercaptopurine Tablets are coadministered, use the lowest possible doses for each drug and monitor more frequently for myelosuppression 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].










7.5 Hepatotoxic Products


Mercaptopurine Tablets can cause hepatotoxicity. Hepatotoxicity may be increased when Mercaptopurine Tablets is coadministered with other products that cause hepatotoxicity. Monitor liver tests more frequently in patients who are receiving Mercaptopurine Tablets with other hepatotoxic products

MEROPENEM for injection, for intravenous use
 







Initial U.S. Approval: 1996",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS





Co-administration of meropenem with probenecid inhibits renal excretion of meropenem and is therefore not recommended. (
     7.1)
    
The concomitant use of meropenem and valproic acid or divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Antibacterial drugs other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (
     5.4, 
     7.2)
    








7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid competes with meropenem for active tubular secretion, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of meropenem. 
         Co-administration of probenecid with meropenem is not recommended.








7.2 Valproic Acid

Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including meropenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction in valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from 
         
 
  
         
 
  
         
 
  in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid. If administration of meropenem is necessary, then supplemental anti-convulsant therapy should be considered

7.5 mg and 15 mg",DI,"Drug Interactions






Diuretics:


Excessive reductions in blood pressure may occur in patients on diuretic therapy when ACE inhibitors are started. The possibility of hypotensive effects with moexipril hydrochloride can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with moexipril hydrochloride. If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexipril should be reduced. (See 
WARNINGS 
 and 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).









Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics:


Moexipril hydrochloride can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient’s serum potassium should be monitored.









Oral Anticoagulants:


Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect.









Lithium:


Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.









Gold:


Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including moexipril hydrochloride.









Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors): 


In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDS, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving moexipril and NSAID therapy. 
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including moexipril, may be attenuated by NSAIDS.









Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS): 


Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on moexipril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS. 
Do not co-administer aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with moexipril hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).









Other Agents:


No clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions occurred when moexipril hydrochloride was administered concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, or cimetidine.

 CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of strong and moderate CYP3A inducers. (7.1)









7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VERZENIO








CYP3A Inhibitors

Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of abemaciclib plus its active metabolites to a clinically meaningful extent and may lead to increased toxicity.









Ketoconazole

Avoid concomitant use of ketoconazole. Ketoconazole is predicted to increase the AUC of abemaciclib by up to 16-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











Other Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

In patients with recommended starting doses of 200 mg twice daily or 150 mg twice daily, reduce the VERZENIO dose to 100 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors other than ketoconazole. In patients who have had a dose reduction to 100 mg twice daily due to adverse reactions, further reduce the VERZENIO dose to 50 mg twice daily with concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors. If a patient taking VERZENIO discontinues a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increase the VERZENIO dose (after 3-5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to the dose that was used before starting the inhibitor. Patients should avoid grapefruit products [see

Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











Moderate CYP3A Inhibitors

With concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions and consider reducing the VERZENIO dose in 50 mg decrements as demonstrated in Table 1, if necessary.













Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers

7.1 Effects of Rufinamide on other AEDs 

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of average concentration at steady state of carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate, and valproate showed that typical rufinamide Cavss levels had little effect on the pharmacokinetics of other AEDs. Any effects, when they occur, have been more marked in the pediatric population.

 a) Predictions are based on rufinamide concentrations at the maximum recommended dose of rufinamide.

 b) Maximum changes predicted to be in pediatric patients and in adult patients who achieve significantly higher levels of rufinamide, as the effect of rufinamide on these AEDs is concentration-dependent. 

 c) Larger effects in pediatric patients at high doses/concentrations of AEDs.

 d) Phenobarbital, primidone and phenytoin were treated as a single covariate (phenobarbital-type inducers) to examine the effect of these agents on rufinamide clearance. 

 e) All compounds of the benzodiazepine class were pooled to examine for ‘class effect’ on rufinamide clearance. 

Phenytoin: The decrease in clearance of phenytoin estimated at typical levels of rufinamide (Cavss 15 mcg/mL) is predicted to increase plasma levels of phenytoin by 7 to 21%. As phenytoin is known to have non-linear pharmacokinetics (clearance becomes saturated at higher doses), it is possible that exposure will be greater than the model prediction.








7.2 Effects of other AEDs on Rufinamide

Potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers, such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, primidone, and phenobarbital, appear to increase the clearance of rufinamide (see Table 6). Given that the majority of clearance of rufinamide is via a non-CYP-dependent route, the observed decreases in blood levels seen with carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone are unlikely to be entirely attributable to induction of a P450 enzyme. Other factors explaining this interaction are not understood. Any effects, where they occurred, were likely to be more marked in the pediatric population.

Valproate

Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose, and titrate to a clinically effective dose. Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.3 Effects of Rufinamide on Hormonal Contraceptives

Female patients of childbearing age should be warned that the concurrent use of rufinamide with hormonal contraceptives may render this method of contraception less effective. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using rufinamide [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Patient Counseling Information (17)].Drug Interactions 



Based on in vitro studies, rufinamide shows little or no inhibition of most cytochrome P450 enzymes at clinically relevant concentrations, with weak inhibition of CYP 2E1. Drugs that are substrates of CYP 2E1 (e.g., chlorzoxazone) may have increased plasma levels in the presence of rufinamide, but this has not been studied.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. In pediatric patients, valproate administration may lead to elevated levels of rufinamide by up to 70% [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. 
Based on in vivo drug interaction studies with triazolam and oral contraceptives, rufinamide is a weak inducer of the CYP 3A4 enzyme and can decrease exposure of drugs that are substrates of CYP 3A4. 


•Co-administration and pre-treatment of rufinamide (400 mg twice daily) and triazolam resulted in a 37% decrease in AUC and a 23% decrease in Cmax of triazolam, a CYP 3A4 substrate. 

•Co-administration of rufinamide (800 mg twice daily for 14 days) and Ortho-Novum 1/35® resulted in a mean decrease in the ethinyl estradiol AUC0 to 24 of 22% and Cmax by 31% and norethindrone AUC0 to 24 by 14% and Cmax by 18%, respectively. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown [see Drug Interactions (7.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]. 

Rufinamide is metabolized by carboxylesterases. Drugs that may induce the activity of carboxylesterases may increase the clearance of rufinamide. Broad-spectrum inducers such as carbamazepine and phenobarbital may have minor effects on rufinamide metabolism via this mechanism. Drugs that are inhibitors of carboxylesterases may decrease metabolism of rufinamide.","carbamazepine,lamotrigine,phenobarbital,phenytoin,topiramate,valproate,primidone,benzodiazepines,chlorzoxazone,triazolam,Ortho-Novum 1/35,ethinyl estradiol,norethindrone"

Coadministration of efavirenz can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentrations of efavirenz. The potential for drug-drug interactions should be considered before and during therapy. (7)








7.1 Potential for Efavirenz to Affect other Drugs

Efavirenz has been shown in vivo to induce CYP3A and CYP2B6. Other compounds that are substrates of CYP3A or CYP2B6 may have decreased plasma concentrations when coadministered with efavirenz. 








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Efavirenz

Drugs that induce CYP3A activity (e.g., phenobarbital, rifampin, rifabutin) would be expected to increase the clearance of efavirenz resulting in lowered plasma concentrations [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].









7.3 QT Prolonging Drugs

There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between efavirenz and drugs that prolong the QTc interval. QTc prolongation has been observed with the use of efavirenz [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider alternatives to efavirenz when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of Torsade de Pointes.

Nitroglycerin: 
Isradipine has been safely coadministered with nitroglycerin.


Hydrochlorothiazide: 
A study in normal healthy volunteers has shown that concomitant administration of isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide does not result in altered pharmacokinetics of either drug. In a study in hypertensive patients, addition of isradipine to existing hydrochlorothiazide therapy did not result in any unexpected adverse effects, and isradipine had an additional antihypertensive effect.


Propranolol: 
In a single dose study in normal volunteers, coadministration of propranolol had a small effect on the rate but no effect on the extent of isradipine bioavailability. Significant increases in AUC (27%) and Cmax (58%) and decreases in tmax (23%) of propranolol were noted in this study. However, concomitant administration of 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine and 40 mg b.i.d. propranolol to healthy volunteers under steady-state conditions had no relevant effect on either drug’s bioavailability. AUC and Cmax differences were <20% between isradipine given singly and in combination with propranolol, and between propranolol given singly and in combination with isradipine.


Cimetidine:
 In a study in healthy volunteers, a one-week course of cimetidine at 400 mg b.i.d. with a single 5 mg dose of isradipine on the sixth day showed an increase in isradipine mean peak plasma concentrations (36%) and significant increase in area under the curve (50%). If isradipine therapy is initiated in a patient currently receiving cimetidine, careful monitoring for adverse reactions is advised and downward dose adjustment may be required.


Rifampicin:
 In a study in healthy volunteers, a six-day course of rifampicin at 600 mg/day followed by a single 5 mg dose of isradipine resulted in a reduction in isradipine levels to below detectable limits. If rifampicin therapy is required, isradipine concentrations and therapeutic effects are likely to be markedly reduced or abolished as a consequence of increased metabolism and higher clearance of isradipine.


Warfarin:
 In a study in healthy volunteers, no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction between isradipine and racemic warfarin was seen when two single oral doses of warfarin (0.7 mg/kg body weight) were administered during 11 days of multiple-dose treatment with 5 mg b.i.d. isradipine. Neither racemic warfarin nor isradipine binding to plasma proteins in vitro was altered by the addition of the other drug.


Digoxin: 
The concomitant administration of isradipine and digoxin in a single-dose pharmacokinetic study did not affect renal, nonrenal and total body clearance of digoxin.


Fentanyl Anesthesia: 
Severe hypotension has been reported during fentanyl anesthesia with concomitant use of a beta blocker and a calcium channel blocker. Even though such interactions have not been seen in clinical studies with isradipine, an increased volume of circulating fluids might be required if such an interaction were to occur.","Nitroglycerin,Hydrochlorothiazide,Propranolol,Cimetidine,Rifampicin,Warfarin,Digoxin,Fentanyl"

GRANISETRON hydrochloride injection, USP for intravenous use

Initial U.S. Approval: 1993",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Granisetron does not induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system in vitro. There have been no definitive drug-drug interaction studies to examine pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic interaction with other drugs; however, in humans, Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection has been safely administered with drugs representing benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and anti-ulcer medications commonly prescribed with antiemetic treatments. Granisetron Hydrochloride Injection also does not appear to interact with emetogenic cancer chemotherapies. Because granisetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of granisetron. No specific interaction studies have been conducted in anesthetized patients. In addition, the activity of the cytochrome P-450 subfamily 3A4 (involved in the metabolism of some of the main narcotic analgesic agents) is not modified by granisetron hydrochloride in vitro.
In in vitro human microsomal studies, ketoconazole inhibited ring oxidation of granisetron hydrochloride. However, the clinical significance of in vivo pharmacokinetic interactions with ketoconazole is not known. In a human pharmacokinetic study, hepatic enzyme induction with phenobarbital resulted in a 25% increase in total plasma clearance of intravenous granisetron hydrochloride. The clinical significance of this change is not known.
QT prolongation has been reported with granisetron hydrochloride. Use of granisetron hydrochloride in patients concurrently treated with drugs known to prolong the QT interval and/or are arrhythmogenic may result in clinical consequences.
Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

7.1 Contraceptives

With concomitant use, FYCOMPA at a dose of 12 mg per day reduced levonorgestrel exposure by approximately 40% [see 

Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of FYCOMPA with contraceptives containing levonorgestrel may render them less effective. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].








7.2 Moderate and Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

The concomitant use of known moderate and strong CYP3A4 inducers including carbamazepine, phenytoin, or oxcarbazepine with FYCOMPA decreased the plasma levels of perampanel by approximately 50-67% [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The starting doses for FYCOMPA should be increased in the presence of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

When these moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers are introduced or withdrawn from a patient’s treatment regimen, the patient should be closely monitored for clinical response and tolerability. Dose adjustment of FYCOMPA may be necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].








7.3 Alcohol and Other CNS Depressants

The concomitant use of FYCOMPA and CNS depressants including alcohol may increase CNS depression. A pharmacodynamic interaction study in healthy subjects found that the effects of FYCOMPA on complex tasks such as driving ability were additive or supra-additive to the impairment effects of alcohol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Multiple dosing of FYCOMPA 12 mg per day also enhanced the effects of alcohol to interfere with vigilance and alertness, and increased levels of anger, confusion, and depression. These effects may also be seen when FYCOMPA is used in combination with other CNS depressants. Care should be taken when administering FYCOMPA with these agents. Patients should limit activity until they have experience with concomitant use of CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, sedating antihistamines). Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FYCOMPA to gauge whether it adversely affects these activities.","levonorgestrel, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, alcohol, benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, sedating antihistamines"

7.1 Drugs that Decrease Busulfan Injection Clearance

Itraconazole decreases busulfan clearance by up to 25%. Metronidazole decreases the clearance of busulfan to a greater extent than does itraconazole; metronidazole coadministration has been associated with increased busulfan toxicity. Fluconazole (200 mg) has been used with Busulfan Injection.
Decreased clearance of busulfan was observed with concomitant use with deferasirox. The mechanism of this interaction is not fully elucidated. Discontinue iron chelating agents well in advance of administration of Busulfan Injection to avoid increased exposure to busulfan.
Because busulfan is eliminated from the body via conjugation with glutathione, use of acetaminophen prior to (less than 72 hours) or concurrent with Busulfan Injection may result in reduced busulfan clearance based upon the known property of acetaminophen to decrease glutathione levels in the blood and tissues.








7.2 Drugs that Increase Busulfan Injection Clearance

Phenytoin increases the clearance of busulfan by 15% or more, possibly due to the induction of glutathione-S-transferase. Since the pharmacokinetics of Busulfan Injection were studied in patients treated with phenytoin, the clearance of Busulfan Injection at the recommended dose may be lower and exposure (AUC) higher in patients not treated with phenytoin.","Metronidazole,itraconazole,iron chelating agents,acetaminophen,phenytoin,fluconazole,deferasirox"

7.1 Effects of Leucovorin Products on Other Drugs








Antiepileptic Drugs

Folic acid in large amounts may counteract the antiepileptic effect of phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone and increase the frequency of seizures in susceptible children. It is not known whether folinic acid has the same effects; however, both folic and folinic acids share some common metabolic pathways. Monitor patients taking folinic acid in combination with antiepileptic drugs.











Fluorouracil

Leucovorin products increase the toxicity of fluorouracil. Do not initiate or continue therapy with levoleucovorin and fluorouracil in patients with symptoms of gastrointestinal toxicity until those symptoms have resolved. Monitor patients with diarrhea until the diarrhea has resolved, as rapid deterioration leading to death can occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].











Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole

The concomitant use of d,l-leucovorin with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the acute treatment of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in patients with HIV infection was associated with increased rates of treatment failure and morbidity in a placebo-controlled study [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","phenobarbital,phenytoin,primidone,fluorouracil,trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole"

 May increase metabolism and decrease the activity of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8/9. Dosage adjustments may be necessary if given concomitantly. (7.4)








7.1 	Protease Inhibitors and Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors

Rifapentine is an inducer of CYP450 enzymes. Concomitant use of PRIFTIN with other drugs metabolized by these enzymes, such as protease inhibitors and certain reverse transcriptase inhibitors, may cause a significant decrease in plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of the protease inhibitor or reverse transcriptase inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)
 and
 Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 	Fixed-Dose Combination of Efavirenz, Emtricitabine, and Tenofovir

Once-weekly coadministration of 900 mg PRIFTIN with the antiretroviral fixed-dose combination of efavirenz 600 mg, emtricitabine 200 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg in HIV-infected patients did not result in any substantial change in steady state exposures of efavirenz, emtricitabine, and tenofovir. No clinically significant change in CD4 cell counts or viral loads were noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 	Hormonal Contraceptives

PRIFTIN may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Patients using hormonal contraception should be advised to use an alternative non-hormonal contraceptive method or add a barrier method of contraception during treatment with PRIFTIN [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)
 and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.4 	Cytochrome P450 3A4 and 2C8/9

Rifapentine is an inducer of cytochromes P450 3A4 and P450 2C8/9. Therefore, PRIFTIN may increase the metabolism of other coadministered drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes. Induction of enzyme activities by PRIFTIN occurred within 4 days after the first dose. Enzyme activities returned to baseline levels 14 days after discontinuing PRIFTIN.
Rifampin has been reported to accelerate the metabolism and may reduce the activity of the following drugs; hence, PRIFTIN may also increase the metabolism and decrease the activity of these drugs. Dosage adjustments of the drugs in Table 4 or of other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 or P450 2C8/9 may be necessary if they are given concurrently with PRIFTIN.

7.5	Other Interactions

The conversion of PRIFTIN to 25-desacetyl rifapentine is mediated by an esterase enzyme. There is minimal potential for PRIFTIN metabolism to be inhibited or induced by another drug, based upon the characteristics of the esterase enzymes.
Since PRIFTIN is highly bound to albumin, drug displacement interactions may also occur [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.6	Interactions with Laboratory Tests

Therapeutic concentrations of rifampin have been shown to inhibit standard microbiological assays for serum folate and Vitamin B12.

Initial U.S. Approval",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Following oral administration, leflunomide is metabolized to an active metabolite, teriflunomide, which is responsible for essentially all of leflunomide’s 
       
 
  in vivo activity. Drug interaction studies have been conducted with both leflunomide and with its active metabolite, teriflunomide, where the metabolite was directly administered to the test subjects.
      

 

Effect of potent CYP and transporter inducers
Leflunomide is metabolized by CYP450 metabolizing enzymes. Concomitant use of leflunomide and rifampin, a potent inducer of CYP and transporters, increased the plasma concentration of teriflunomide by 40%. However, when co-administered with the metabolite, teriflunomide, rifampin did not affect its pharmacokinetics. No dosage adjustment is recommended for leflunomide when coadministered with rifampin. Because of the potential for leflunomide concentrations to continue to increase with multiple dosing, caution should be used if patients are to be receiving both leflunomide and rifampin 
       
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
        
  
   12.3)].
       
 
  


Effect on CYP2C8 substrates
Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 
       
 
  in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required 
       
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
        
  
   12.3)].
       
 
  


Effect on warfarin
Coadministration of leflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%.
      

 

Effect on oral contraceptives
Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with leflunomide 
       
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
        
  
   12.3)]
       
 
  .
      

 

Effect on CYP1A2 substrates
Teriflunomide, the active metabolite of leflunomide, may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 
       
 
  in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required 
       
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
        
  
   12.3)]
       
 
  .
      

 

Effect on organic anion transporter 3 (OAT3) substrates
Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 
       
 
  in vivo. In patients taking leflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required 
       
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

Effect on BCRP and organic anion transporting polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) substrates
        
  
   
Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 
       
 
  in vivo. For a patient taking leflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking leflunomide

7.1 Potential for Famciclovir to Affect Other Drugs

The steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin were not altered by concomitant administration of multiple doses of famciclovir (500 mg three times daily). No clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of zidovudine, its metabolite zidovudine glucuronide, or emtricitabine was observed following a single oral dose of 500 mg famciclovir coadministered with zidovudine or emtricitabine. 
An 
         
 
  in vitro study using human liver microsomes suggests that famciclovir is not an inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzymes. 
        

 








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Penciclovir

No clinically significant alterations in penciclovir pharmacokinetics were observed following single-dose administration of 500 mg famciclovir after pretreatment with multiple doses of allopurinol, cimetidine, theophylline, zidovudine, promethazine, when given shortly after an antacid (magnesium and aluminum hydroxide), or concomitantly with emtricitabine. No clinically significant effect on penciclovir pharmacokinetics was observed following multiple-dose (three times daily) administration of famciclovir (500 mg) with multiple doses of digoxin. 
Concurrent use with probenecid or other drugs significantly eliminated by active renal tubular secretion may result in increased plasma concentrations of penciclovir. 
The conversion of 6-deoxy penciclovir to penciclovir is catalyzed by aldehyde oxidase. Interactions with other drugs metabolized by this enzyme and/or inhibiting this enzyme could potentially occur. Clinical interaction studies of famciclovir with cimetidine and promethazine, 
         
 
  in vitro inhibitors of aldehyde oxidase, did not show relevant effects on the formation of penciclovir. Raloxifene, a potent aldehyde oxidase inhibitor

Other Biological Products – increased risk of serious infections (7.1)







7.1	Other Biological Products

The combination of RENFLEXIS with other biological products used to treat the same conditions as RENFLEXIS is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
An increased risk of serious infections was seen in clinical studies of other TNF blockers used in combination with anakinra or abatacept, with no added clinical benefit. Because of the nature of the adverse reactions seen with these combinations with TNF blocker therapy, similar toxicities may also result from the combination of anakinra or abatacept with other TNF blockers. Therefore, the combination of RENFLEXIS and anakinra or abatacept is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].
The concomitant use of tocilizumab with biological DMARDs such as TNF antagonists, including RENFLEXIS, should be avoided because of the possibility of increased immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.








7.2	Methotrexate and Other Concomitant Medications

Specific drug interaction studies, including interactions with methotrexate (MTX), have not been conducted. The majority of patients in RA or CD clinical studies received one or more concomitant medications. In RA, concomitant medications besides MTX were nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), folic acid, corticosteroids and/or narcotics. Concomitant CD medications were antibiotics, antivirals, corticosteroids, 6-MP/AZA and aminosalicylates. In PsA clinical trials, concomitant medications included MTX in approximately half of the patients as well as NSAIDs, folic acid and corticosteroids. Concomitant MTX use may decrease the incidence of anti-drug antibody production and increase infliximab product concentrations.








7.3	Immunosuppressants

Patients with CD who received immunosuppressants tended to experience fewer infusion reactions compared to patients on no immunosuppressants [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Serum infliximab concentrations appeared to be unaffected by baseline use of medications for the treatment of CD including corticosteroids, antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin) and aminosalicylates.








7.4	Cytochrome P450 Substrates

The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased levels of cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, IFN) during chronic inflammation. Therefore, it is expected that for a molecule that antagonizes cytokine activity, such as infliximab products, the formation of CYP450 enzymes could be normalized. Upon initiation or discontinuation of RENFLEXIS in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.








7.5	Live Vaccines/Therapeutic Infectious Agents

It is recommended that live vaccines not be given concurrently with RENFLEXIS. It is also recommended that live vaccines not be given to infants after in utero exposure to infliximab products for at least 6 months following birth [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

7.1 Warfarin

Concomitant administration of miconazole and warfarin has resulted in enhancement of anticoagulant effect.  Cases of bleeding and bruising following the concomitant use of warfarin and topical, intravaginal, or oral miconazole were reported.  Closely monitor prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests if ORAVIG is administered concomitantly with warfarin.  Also monitor for evidence of bleeding.








7.2 Drugs Metabolized Through CYP 2C9 and 3A4

No formal drug interaction studies have been performed with ORAVIG. Miconazole is a known inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4.  Although the systemic absorption of miconazole following ORAVIG administration is minimal and plasma concentrations of miconazole are substantially lower than when given intravenously, the potential for interaction with drugs metabolized through CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 such as oral hypoglycemics, phenytoin, or ergot alkaloids cannot be ruled out.","Warfarin, oral hypoglycemics, phenytoin, ergot alkaloids"

7.1 Potential
for Other Drugs to Affect Etravirine

Etravirine is a substrate of CYP3A, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. Therefore, co-administration of etravirine with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of etravirine (see Table 4)

7.2 Potential
for Etravirine to Affect Other Drugs

Etravirine is an inducer of CYP3A and inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, co-administration of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 or are transported by P-gp with etravirine may alter the therapeutic effect or adverse reaction profile of the co-administered drug(s) (see Table 4)

posaconazole


↑ etravirine
↓ itraconazole
↓ ketoconazole
↔ posaconazole


Posaconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine. Itraconazole and ketoconazole are potent inhibitors as well as substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant systemic use of itraconazole or ketoconazole and etravirine may increase plasma concentrations of etravirine.
Simultaneously, plasma concentrations of itraconazole or ketoconazole may be decreased by etravirine. Dose adjustments for itraconazole, ketoconazole or posaconazole may be necessary depending on the other co-administered drugs.





Antiinfective:
            
    
     
clarithromycin*


↑ etravirine
↓ clarithromycin
↑ 14-OH-clarithromycin


Clarithromycin exposure was decreased by etravirine; however, concentrations of the active metabolite, 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin, were increased. Because 14-hydroxy-clarithromycin has reduced activity against 
             
     
      Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), overall activity against this pathogen may be altered.
            
    
     
Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered for the treatment of MAC.





Antimalarial:
            
    
     
artemether/lumefantrine*


↔ etravirine
↓ artemether
↓ dihydroartemisinin
↓ lumefantrine


Caution is warranted when co-administering etravirine and artemether/lumefantrine as it is unknown whether the decrease in exposure of artemether or its active metabolite, dihydroartemisinin, could result in decreased antimalarial efficacy. No dose adjustment is needed for etravirine.





Antimycobacterials:

rifampin
rifapentine


↓ etravirine


Rifampin and rifapentine are potent inducers of CYP450 enzymes. Etravirine should not be used with rifampin or rifapentine as co-administration may cause significant decreases in etravirine plasma concentrations and loss of therapeutic effect of etravirine.

Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution. (5.7, 7.2, 7.3) 
MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and drugs that prolong the QTc interval may potentiate effect on the cardiovascular system. Use with extreme caution. (7.4)
Beta-blockers may decrease effectiveness. May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists. Use with caution and only when medically necessary. (7.5)








7.1 Adrenergic Drugs

If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of arformoterol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)].








7.2 Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics

Concomitant treatment with methylxanthine (aminophylline, theophylline), steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of adrenergic agonists including arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution[ see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].
The concurrent use of intravenously or orally administered methylxanthines (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) by patients receiving arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution has not been completely evaluated. In two combined 12-week, placebo-controlled trials that included arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution doses of 15 mcg twice daily, 25 mcg twice daily, and 50 mcg once daily, 54 of 873 arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution-treated subjects received concomitant theophylline at study entry. In a 12-month controlled trial that included a 50 mcg once daily arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution dose, 30 of the 528 arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution-treated subjects received concomitant theophylline at study entry. In these trials, heart rate and systolic blood pressure were approximately 2-3 bpm and 6-8 mm Hg higher, respectively, in subjects on concomitant theophylline compared with the overall population.








7.3 Non-potassium Sparing Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the co-administration of beta-agonists, including arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, with non-potassium sparing diuretics.








7.4 MAO Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs

Arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution, as with other beta-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because of the effect of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.








7.5 Beta-Blockers

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution may inhibit the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. 
Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.","adrenergic drugs, xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, non-potassium sparing diuretics, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, drugs that prolong the QTc interval, beta-blockers, methylxanthine, aminophylline, theophylline, loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists"

7.1 Didanosine

Tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology 
   (12.3)].
  
Coadministration of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of tenofovir and/or the coadministered drug. Some examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs 
  [see Warnings and Precautions 
   (5.2)]. 
  Drugs that decrease renal function may increase concentrations of tenofovir.
  

In the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets should not be administered in combination with HEPSERA (adefovir dipivoxil).

Patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets and didanosine should be monitored closely for didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Discontinue didanosine in patients who develop didanosine-associated adverse reactions. Higher didanosine concentrations could potentiate didanosine-associated adverse reactions, including pancreatitis, and neuropathy. Suppression of CD4+ cell counts has been observed in patients receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets with didanosine 400 mg daily.
     

			In patients weighing greater than 60 kg, reduce the didanosine dose to 250 mg when it is coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets. In patients weighing less than 60 kg, reduce the didanosine dose to 200 mg when it is coadministered with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets.

7.1	Potent CYP2D6 Inhibitors

Fluoxetine, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 activity, significantly inhibited the metabolism of tolterodine immediate release in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, resulting in a 4.8-fold increase in tolterodine AUC. There was a 52% decrease in Cmax and a 20% decrease in AUC of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the pharmacologically active metabolite of tolterodine [see
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.1)
]. The sums of unbound serum concentrations of tolterodine and 5-HMT are only 25% higher during the interaction. No dose adjustment is required when tolterodine and fluoxetine are co-administered [see
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)
].









7.2	Potent CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Ketoconazole (200 mg daily), a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the mean Cmax and AUC of tolterodine by 2- and 2.5-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. 
For patients receiving ketoconazole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, or ritonavir, the recommended dose of DETROL LA is 2 mg once daily [see
 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION(2.2) 
and
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)

No clinically relevant interactions have been observed when tolterodine was co-administered with warfarin, with a combined oral contraceptive drug containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, or with diuretics [see
 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3)
].









7.4	Other Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes


In vivo drug-interaction data show that tolterodine immediate release does not result in clinically relevant inhibition of CYP1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 as evidenced by lack of influence on the marker drugs caffeine, debrisoquine, S-warfarin, and omeprazole [see

and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

In a clinical metabolic inhibition study, a 3.8-fold increase in silodosin maximum plasma concentrations and 3.2-fold increase in silodosin exposure were observed with concurrent administration of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, 400 mg ketoconazole. Use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or ritonavir may cause plasma concentrations of silodosin to increase. Concomitant administration of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and silodosin is contraindicated

The effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of silodosin has not been evaluated. Concomitant administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., diltiazem, erythromycin, verapamil) may increase concentration of silodosin. Exercise caution and monitor patients for adverse events when co-administering silodosin with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors.








7.2 Strong P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) Inhibitors


In vitro studies indicated that silodosin is a P-gp substrate. Ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 inhibitor that also inhibits P-gp, caused significant increase in exposure to silodosin. Inhibition of P-gp may lead to increased silodosin concentration. Silodosin is therefore not recommended in patients taking strong P-gp inhibitors such as cyclosporine

The effect of co-administration of silodosin and digoxin 0.25 mg/day for 7 days was evaluated in a clinical trial in 16 healthy males, aged 18 to 45 years. Concomitant administration of silodosin and digoxin did not significantly alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of digoxin. No dose adjustment is required.








7.5 PDE5 Inhibitors

Co-administration of silodosin with a single dose of 100 mg sildenafil or 20 mg tadalafil was evaluated in a placebo-controlled clinical study that included 24 healthy male subjects, 45 to 78 years of age. Orthostatic vital signs were monitored in the 12-hour period following concomitant dosing. During this period, the total number of positive orthostatic test results was greater in the group receiving silodosin plus a PDE5 inhibitor compared with silodosin alone. No events of symptomatic orthostasis or dizziness were reported in subjects receiving silodosin with a PDE5 inhibitor.








7.6 Other
Concomitant Drug Therapy


Antihypertensives

The pharmacodynamic interactions between silodosin and antihypertensives have not been rigorously investigated in a clinical study. However, approximately one-third of the patients in clinical studies used concomitant antihypertensive medications with silodosin. The incidence of dizziness and orthostatic hypotension in these patients was higher than in the general silodosin population (4.6% versus 3.8% and 3.4% versus 3.2%, respectively). Exercise caution during concomitant use with antihypertensives and monitor patients for possible adverse events

Metabolic Interactions


In vitro data indicate that silodosin does not have the potential to inhibit or induce cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
        

 








7.7 Food Interactions

The effect of a moderate fat, moderate calorie meal on silodosin pharmacokinetics was variable and decreased silodosin maximum plasma concentration (C
         
 
  max) by approximately 18% to 43% and exposure (AUC) by 4% to 49% across three different studies. Safety and efficacy clinical trials for silodosin were always conducted in the presence of food intake.

In vivo data suggest that alosetron is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, with minor contributions from CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance of alosetron.






CYP1A2 inhibitors: Avoid concomitant uses because of increased exposure and half-life of alosetron. Use with fluvoxamine is contraindicated. (4.3, 7.1)
CYP3A4 inhibitors: Use with caution in combination due to increased exposure of alosetron. (7.2)







7.1 CYP1A2 Inhibitors

Fluvoxamine is a known strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 and also inhibits CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19. In a pharmacokinetic study, 40 healthy female subjects received fluvoxamine in escalating doses from 50 to 200 mg/day for 16 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Fluvoxamine increased mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) approximately 6-fold and prolonged the half-life by approximately 3-fold. Concomitant administration of alosetron and fluvoxamine is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.3)].  
Concomitant administration of alosetron and moderate CYP1A2 inhibitors, including quinolone antibiotics and cimetidine, has not been evaluated, but should be avoided unless clinically necessary because of similar potential drug interactions.







7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Ketoconazole is a known strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. In a pharmacokinetic study, 38 healthy female subjects received ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, with coadministration of alosetron 1 mg on the last day. Ketoconazole increased mean alosetron plasma concentrations (AUC) by 29%. Caution should be used when alosetron and ketoconazole are administered concomitantly. Coadministration of alosetron and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, telithromycin, protease inhibitors, voriconazole, and itraconazole has not been evaluated but should be undertaken with caution because of similar potential drug interactions. The effect of induction or inhibition of other pathways on exposure to alosetron and its metabolites is not known. 







7.3 Other CYP Enzymes


In vitro human liver microsome studies and an in vivo metabolic probe study demonstrated that alosetron did not inhibit CYP enzymes 3A4, 2C9, or 2C19. In vitro at total drug concentrations 27-fold higher than peak plasma concentrations observed with the 1 mg dose, alosetron inhibited CYP enzymes 1A2 (60%) and 2E1 (50%). In an in vivo metabolic probe study, alosetron did not inhibit CYP2E1 but did produce 30% inhibition of both CYP1A2 and N-acetyltransferase. Although not studied with alosetron, inhibition of N-acetyltransferase may have clinically relevant consequences for drugs such as isoniazid, procainamide, and hydralazine. The effect on CYP1A2 was explored further in a clinical interaction study with theophylline and no effect on metabolism was observed. Another study showed that alosetron had no clinically significant effect on plasma concentrations of the oral contraceptive agents ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (CYP3A4 substrates). A clinical interaction study was also conducted with alosetron and the CYP3A4 substrate cisapride. No significant effects on cisapride metabolism or QT interval were noted. The effects of alosetron on monoamine oxidases and on intestinal first pass secondary to high intraluminal concentrations have not been examined. Based on the above data from in vitro and in vivo studies, it is unlikely that alosetron will inhibit the hepatic metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by the CYP enzymes 2C9, 2C19, or 2E1. 
Alosetron does not appear to induce the major cytochrome P450 drug-metabolizing enzyme 3A. Alosetron also does not appear to induce CYP enzymes 2E1 or 2C19. It is not known whether alosetron might induce other enzymes.","Fluvoxamine, quinolone antibiotics, cimetidine, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, protease inhibitors, voriconazole, itraconazole, isoniazid, procainamide, hydralazine, theophylline, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgestrel, cisapride"

Cimetidine tablets, apparently through an effect on certain microsomal enzyme systems, has been reported to reduce the hepatic metabolism of warfarin-type anticoagulants, phenytoin, propranolol, nifedipine, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, certain tricyclic antidepressants, lidocaine, theophylline, and metronidazole, thereby delaying elimination and increasing blood levels of these drugs.
Clinically significant effects have been reported with the warfarin anticoagulants; therefore, close monitoring of prothrombin time is recommended, and adjustment of the anticoagulant dose may be necessary when cimetidine tablets are administered concomitantly. Interaction with phenytoin, lidocaine, and theophylline has also been reported to produce adverse clinical effects.
However, a crossover study in healthy subjects receiving either 300 mg 4 times daily or 800 mg at bedtime of cimetidine tablets concomitantly with a 300 mg twice-daily dose of theophylline extended-release tablets demonstrated less alteration in steady-state theophylline peak serum levels with the 800 mg at bedtime regimen, particularly in subjects aged 54 years and older. Data beyond 10 days are not available. (Note: All patients receiving theophylline should be monitored appropriately, regardless of concomitant drug therapy.)
Dosage of the drugs mentioned above and other similarly metabolized drugs, particularly those of low therapeutic ratio or in patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require adjustment when starting or stopping the concomitant administration of cimetidine tablets to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.
Alteration of pH may affect absorption of certain drugs (e.g., ketoconazole). If these products are needed, they should be given at least 2 hours before cimetidine administration.

""Initial U.S. Approval: 1959""",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Cyclophosphamide is a pro-drug that is activated by cytochrome P450s 
       
 
  [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (
        
  
   12.3)]
       
 
  . 
      

 
An increase of the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites may occur with: 

Protease inhibitors: Concomitant use of protease inhibitors may increase the concentration of cytotoxic metabolites. Use of protease inhibitor-based regimens was found to be associated with a higher incidence of infections and neutropenia in patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide (CDE) than use of a Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor-based regimen. 
       

Combined or sequential use of cyclophosphamide and other agents with similar toxicities can potentiate toxicities. 

Increased hematotoxicity and/or immunosuppression may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: 
        
  
   
ACE inhibitors: ACE inhibitors can cause leukopenia. 
         
Natalizumab 
         
Paclitaxel: Increased hematotoxicity has been reported when cyclophosphamide was administered after paclitaxel infusion. 
         
Thiazide diuretics 
         
Zidovudine
         


Increased cardiotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example: 
        
  
   
Anthracyclines 
         


Cytarabine 
       
Pentostatin 
       
Radiation therapy of the cardiac region 
       
Trastuzumab 
       
Increased pulmonary toxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
        
  
   
Amiodarone 
         
G-CSF, GM-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor): Reports suggest an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy that includes cyclophosphamide and G-CSF or GMCSF. 
         


Increased nephrotoxicity may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and, for example:
        
  
   
Amphotericin B 
         
Indomethacin: Acute water intoxication has been reported with concomitant use of indomethacin
         


Increase in other toxicities: 
        
  
   
Azathioprine: Increased risk of hepatotoxicity (liver necrosis) 
         
Busulfan: Increased incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease and mucositis has been reported.
         
Protease inhibitors: Increased incidence of mucositis 
         


Increased risk of hemorrhagic cystitis may result from a combined effect of cyclophosphamide and past or concomitant radiation treatment. 
       

Etanercept: In patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis, the addition of etanercept to standard treatment, including cyclophosphamide, was associated with a higher incidence of non-cutaneous malignant solid tumors. 
Metronidazole: Acute encephalopathy has been reported in a patient receiving cyclophosphamide and metronidazole. Causal association is unclear. In an animal study, the combination of cyclophosphamide with metronidazole was associated with increased cyclophosphamide toxicity. 
Tamoxifen: Concomitant use of tamoxifen and chemotherapy may increase the risk of thromboembolic complications. 
Coumarins: Both increased and decreased warfarin effect have been reported in patients receiving warfarin and cyclophosphamide. 
Cyclosporine: Lower serum concentrations of cyclosporine have been observed in patients receiving a combination of cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine than in patients receiving only cyclosporine. This interaction may result in an increased incidence of graft-versus-host disease. 
Depolarizing muscle relaxants: Cyclophosphamide treatment causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity. Prolonged apnea may occur with concurrent depolarizing muscle relaxants (e.g., succinylcholine). If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, alert the anesthesiologist.","Protease inhibitors,doxorubicin,etoposide,ACE inhibitors,natalizumab,paclitaxel,thiazide diuretics,zidovudine,anthracyclines,cytarabine,pentostatin,trastuzumab,amiodarone,G-CSF,GM-CSF,amphotericin B,indomethacin,azathioprine,busulfan,etanercept,metronidazole,tamoxifen,coumarins,warfarin,cyclosporine,depolarizing muscle relaxants,succinylcholine"

See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with piroxicam.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Piroxicam










Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis






Clinical


Impact: 


•Piroxicam and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of piroxicam and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.•Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.




Intervention: 



Monitor patients with concomitant use of piroxicam capsules with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].





Aspirin






Clinical


Impact: 



Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].





Intervention: 



Concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].

Piroxicam capsules are not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.





ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical


Impact: 


•NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol).•In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.




Intervention: 


•During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.•During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. •When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.




Diuretics






Clinical


Impact: 



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].





Digoxin






Clinical


Impact: 



The concomitant use of piroxicam with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical


Impact: 



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical


Impact: 



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical


Impact: 



Concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical


Impact: 



Concomitant use of piroxicam with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 






Intervention: 



The concomitant use of piroxicam with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical


Impact: 



Concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention: 



During concomitant use of piroxicam capsules and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.

NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.

In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.





Highly Protein Bound Drugs






Clinical


Impact:


Piroxicam capsules is highly protein bound and, therefore, might be expected to displace other protein bound drugs.





Intervention:


Physicians should closely monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering piroxicam capsules to patients on other highly protein bound drugs.





Corticosteroids






Clinical 


Impact: 



Concomitant use of corticosteroids with piroxicam capsules may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.





Intervention: 



Monitor patients with concomitant use of piroxicam capsules with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Other adrenergic drugs may potentiate effect. Use with caution. (5.3, 7.1)
Xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, or non-potassium sparing diuretics may potentiate hypokalemia or ECG changes. Use with caution. (5.7, 7.2, 7.3)
MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and drugs that prolong QTc interval may potentiate effect on the cardiovascular system. Use with extreme caution. (7.4)
Beta-blockers may decrease effectiveness. Use with caution and only when medically necessary. (7.5)








7.1
Adrenergic Drugs

If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution because the sympathetic effects of formoterol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)].








7.2
Xanthine Derivatives, Steroids, or Diuretics

Concomitant treatment with xanthine derivatives, steroids, or diuretics may potentiate any hypokalemic effect of adrenergic agonists [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].








7.3
Non-potassium Sparing Diuretics

The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium sparing diuretics.








7.4
MAO Inhibitors, Tricyclic Antidepressants, QTc Prolonging Drugs

Formoterol, as with other beta2-agonists, should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, or drugs known to prolong the QTc interval because the effect of adrenergic agonists on the cardiovascular system may be potentiated by these agents. Drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval have an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias.








7.5
Beta-blockers

Beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists (beta-blockers) and formoterol may inhibit the effect of each other when administered concurrently. Beta-blockers not only block the therapeutic effects of beta-agonists, but may produce severe bronchospasm in COPD patients. Therefore, patients with COPD should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-blockers in patients with COPD. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.","adrenergic drugs, xanthine derivatives, steroids, diuretics, non-potassium sparing diuretics, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, drugs that prolong QTc interval, beta-blockers"

SYNDROS® (dronabinol) oral solution, CII
			Initial U.S. Approval: 1985",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS






Inhibitors and Inducers of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4: May alter dronabinol systemic exposure; monitor for dronabinol-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy. (7.2)

Highly Protein-Bound Drugs: Potential for displacement of other drugs from plasma proteins; monitor for adverse reactions to concomitant narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, or amphotericin B) when initiating or increasing the dosage of SYNDROS. (7.3)








7.1 Disulfiram and Metronidazole

SYNDROS contains 50% (w/w) dehydrated alcohol and 5.5% (w/w) propylene glycol, which can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other drugs that produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole). Discontinue products containing disulfiram or metronidazole at least 14 days before starting treatment with SYNDROS and do not administer these products within 7 days of completing treatment with SYNDROS [see Contraindications (
4
), Warnings and Precautions (
5.3
)].
When administered concomitantly with propylene glycol, ethanol competitively inhibits the metabolism of propylene glycol, which may lead to elevated concentrations of propylene glycol. However, the contribution of propylene glycol, if any, to the interaction between disulfiram and SYNDROS is unknown.








7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on Dronabinol

Dronabinol is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes. Inhibitors of these enzymes may increase, while inducers may decrease, the systemic exposure of dronabinol and/or its active metabolite resulting in an increase in dronabinol-related adverse reactions or loss of efficacy of SYNDROS.
Monitor for increased dronabinol-related adverse reactions when SYNDROS is co-administered with inhibitors of CYP2C9 (e.g., amiodarone, fluconazole) and inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice).








7.3 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs

Dronabinol is highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace and increase the free fraction of other concomitantly administered protein-bound drugs. Although this displacement has not been confirmed in vivo, monitor patients for increased adverse reactions to narrow therapeutic index drugs (e.g., warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B) when initiating treatment or increasing the dosage of SYNDROS.","disulfiram, metronidazole, amiodarone, fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, warfarin, cyclosporine, amphotericin B"

     [see
     
      Dosage and Administration (2.7)].
    
     




Strong CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of REXULTI and a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of brexpiprazole compared to the use of REXULTI alone
    
     [see
     
      Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
    
     




Intervention:

Initial U.S. Approval:  1999",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators or epinephrine should not be used concomitantly with Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol.  If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.







Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators and adrenergic drugs: May potentiate effect. (7)


Beta-blockers: May block bronchodilatory effects of beta-agonists and produce severe bronchospasm.  Patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. (7.1)


Diuretics: May worsen electrocardiographic changes or hypokalemia associated with diuretics may worsen. Consider monitoring potassium levels. (7.2)


Digoxin: May decrease serum digoxin levels. Consider monitoring digoxin levels. (7.3)


Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOs) or tricyclic antidepressants: May potentiate effect of albuterol on the cardiovascular system. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants. (7.4)









7.1 Beta-blockers


Beta-blockers:  Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-adrenergic agonists, such as Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients.  Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers.  However, under certain circumstances, e.g., as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma.  In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers should be considered, although they should be administered with caution.









7.2 Diuretics


The ECG changes or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non-potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop and thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded.  Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of beta-agonists with non-potassium-sparing diuretics.  Consider monitoring potassium levels.









7.3 Digoxin


Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of racemic albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days.  The clinical significance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear.  Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol.









7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors or Tricyclic Antidepressants


Levalbuterol tartrate HFA inhalation aerosol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within 2 weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated. Consider alternative therapy in patients taking MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants.","epinephrine,short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators,adrenergic drugs,beta-blockers,diuretics,digoxin,monoamine oxidase inhibitors,tricyclic antidepressants,loop diuretics,thiazide diuretics"

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions With Vilazodone Hydrochloride Tablets


Table 4: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Vilazodone Hydrochloride Tablets











Concomitant Drug Name or Drug Class 


Clinical Rationale 


Clinical Recommendation 



Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

The concomitant use of MAOIs and serotonergic drugs including vilazodone hydrochloride tablets increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Vilazodone hydrochloride tablets are contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Contraindications (4), Dosage and Administration (2.3), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Other Serotonergic Drugs

Concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets with other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.

Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during vilazodone hydrochloride tablets initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with vilazodone hydrochloride tablets may potentiate the risk of bleeding.

Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding with the concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) when initiating, titrating,  or discontinuing vilazodone hydrochloride tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].




Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole)

The concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of vilazodone compared to the use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


The vilazodone hydrochloride tablet dose should not exceed 20 mg once daily with the concomitant use of a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Strong CYP3A4Inducers (e.g.,carbamazepine,phenytoin,rifampin)

The concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers decreased the exposure of vilazodone compared to the use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Based on clinical response, consider increasing thedosage of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets, over 1 to 2 weeks in patientstaking strong CYP3A4 inducers for greater than 14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Digoxin

Digoxin is a narrow therapeutic index drug. Concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets increased digoxin concentrations [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating concomitant use of vilazodone hydrochloride tablets. Continue monitoring and reduce digoxin dose as necessary.












7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions With Vilazodone Hydrochloride Tablets

Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment is required for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and/or P-glycoprotein (except narrow therapeutic index drugs, e.g., digoxin), when vilazodone hydrochloride tablets are administered concomitantly [see Drug Interactions (7.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, St. John's Wort, antiplatelet agents, anticoagulants, warfarin, itraconazole, clarithromycin, voriconazole, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, digoxin"

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on ERLEADA







Strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Co-administration of a strong CYP2C8 or CYP3A4 inhibitor is predicted to increase the steady-state exposure of the active moieties (sum of unbound apalutamide plus the potency-adjusted unbound N-desmethyl-apalutamide). No initial dose adjustment is necessary however, reduce the ERLEADA dose based on tolerability
 
  [see

7.2 Effect of ERLEADA on Other Drugs







CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and UGT Substrates

ERLEADA is a strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, and a weak inducer of CYP2C9 in humans. Concomitant use of ERLEADA with medications that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 can result in lower exposure to these medications. Substitution for these medications is recommended when possible or evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued. Concomitant administration of ERLEADA with medications that are substrates of UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) can result in decreased exposure. Use caution if substrates of UGT must be co-administered with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 










P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 Substrates

Apalutamide was shown to be a weak inducer of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) clinically. At steady-state, apalutamide reduced the plasma exposure to fexofenadine (a P-gp substrate) and rosuvastatin (a BCRP/OATP1B1 substrate). Concomitant use of ERLEADA with medications that are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OATP1B1 can result in lower exposure of these medications. Use caution if substrates of P-gp, BCRP or OATP1B1 must be co-administered with ERLEADA and evaluate for loss of activity if medication is continued

Tetracycline, a bacteriostatic antibiotic, may antagonize the bactericidal effect of penicillin and concurrent use of these drugs should be avoided.
Probenecid administered concomitantly with penicillins increases and prolongs serum penicillin levels (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).
Penicillinase-resistant penicillins, like other penicillins, are physically and/or chemically incompatible with aminoglycosides and can inactivate the drugs in vitro. In vitro mixing of penicillins and aminoglycosides should be avoided during concomitant therapy and the drugs should be administered separately. Penicillins can inactivate aminoglycosides in vitro in serum samples from patients receiving both drugs, which could produce falsely decreased results in serum aminoglycoside assays of the serum samples.
Dicloxacillin may reduce the anticoagulant response to dicumarol and warfarin. Careful monitoring of prothrombin times is suggested during concomitant therapy, and dosage of the anticoagulant should be adjusted as required. The mechanism of this possible interaction is unclear, but may be due to hepatic enzyme induction.","Tetracycline,Probenecid,Aminoglycosides,Dicumarol,Warfarin"

Based on the long terminal half-life of mifepristone after reaching steady state, at least 2 weeks should elapse after cessation of mifepristone before initiating or increasing the dose of any interacting concomitant medication.






Drugs metabolized by CYP3A: Administer drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A at the lowest dose when used with mifepristone (7.1).
CYP3A inhibitors: Caution should be used when mifepristone is used with strong CYP3A inhibitors. Limit mifepristone dose to 900 mg per day when used with strong CYP3A inhibitors (7.2).
CYP3A inducers: Do not use mifepristone with CYP3A inducers (7.3).
Drugs metabolized by CYP2C8/2C9: Use the lowest dose of CYP2C8/2C9 substrates when used with mifepristone (7.4).
Drugs metabolized by CYP2B6: Use of mifepristone should be done with caution with bupropion and efavirenz (7.5).
Hormonal contraceptives: Do not use with mifepristone (7.6).








7.1 Drugs Metabolized
by CYP3A

Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP3A, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP3A is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug. Discontinuation or dose reduction of such medications may be necessary with mifepristone coadministration.
Mifepristone increased the exposure to simvastatin and simvastatin acid significantly in healthy subjects. Concomitant use of simvastatin or lovastatin is contraindicated because of the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis [see Contraindications (4.2), Clinical Pharmacology 12.3].
The exposure of other substrates of CYP3A with narrow therapeutic ranges, such as cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, and tacrolimus, may be increased by concomitant administration with mifepristone. Therefore, the concomitant use of such CYP3A substrates with mifepristone is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.2)].
Other drugs with similar high first pass metabolism in which CYP3A is the primary route of metabolism should be used with extreme caution if coadministered with mifepristone. The lowest possible dose and/or a decreased frequency of dosing must be used with therapeutic drug monitoring when possible. Use of alternative drugs without these metabolic characteristics is advised when possible with concomitant mifepristone.
If drugs that undergo low first pass metabolism by CYP3A or drugs in which CYP3A is not the major metabolic route are coadministered with mifepristone, use the lowest dose of concomitant medication necessary, with appropriate monitoring and follow-up [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 CYP3A Inhibitors

Medications that inhibit CYP3A could increase plasma mifepristone concentrations and dose reduction of mifepristone may be required.
Ketoconazole and other strong inhibitors of CYP3A, such as itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir and fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, or voriconazole may increase exposure to mifepristone. Caution should be used when strong CYP3A inhibitors are prescribed in combination with mifepristone. The benefit of concomitant use of these agents should be carefully weighed against the potential risks. The dose of mifepristone should be limited to 900 mg, and strong inhibitors of CYP3A should be used only when necessary [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings & Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 CYP3A Inducers

No medications that induce CYP3A have been studied when coadministered with mifepristone. Avoid coadministration of mifepristone and CYP3A inducers such as rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s wort.








7.4 Drugs Metabolized
by CYP2C8/2C9

Because mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2C8/2C9, concurrent use of mifepristone with a drug whose metabolism is largely or solely mediated by CYP2C8/2C9 is likely to result in increased plasma concentrations of the drug.
Mifepristone significantly increased exposure of fluvastatin, a typical CYP2C8/2C9 substrate, in healthy subjects. When given concomitantly with mifepristone, drugs that are substrates of CYP2C8/2C9 (including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and repaglinide) should be used at the smallest recommended doses, and patients should be closely monitored for adverse effects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.5 Drugs Metabolized
by CYP2B6

Mifepristone is an inhibitor of CYP2B6 and may cause significant increases in exposure of drugs that are metabolized by CYP2B6 such as bupropion and efavirenz. Since no study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of mifepristone on substrates of CYP2B6, the concomitant use of bupropion and efavirenz should be undertaken with caution [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.6 Use of Hormonal
Contraceptives

Mifepristone is a progesterone-receptor antagonist and will interfere with the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives. Therefore, non-hormonal contraceptive methods should be used [See Use In Specific Populations (8.3)].","simvastatin, lovastatin, cyclosporine, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir/ritonavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wort, fluvastatin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, repaglinide, bupropion, efavirenz"

Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants


Although Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection possesses opioid antagonist activity, there is evidence that in nondependent patients it will not antagonize an opioid analgesic administered just before, concurrently, or just after an injection of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection. Therefore, due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of other opioid analgesics, benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants such as alcohol, other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids, can increase the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation [see 
WARNINGS
].









Serotonergic Drugs


The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see 
PRECAUTIONS; Information for Patients
].
If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.









Muscle Relaxants


Nalbuphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.









Diuretics


Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.
Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.









Anticholinergic Drugs


The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.
Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.









Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)


MAOI (e.g., phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid) interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [see 
Drug Interactions
] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma [see 
WARNINGS
]).
The use of Nalbuphine Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.
If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.","Benzodiazepines, alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, opioids, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, phenelzine, tranylcypromine"

7.1 Potential for Darunavir/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A, CYP2D6, and P-gp. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir with drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A and CYP2D6 or are transported by P-gp may result in increased plasma concentrations of such drugs, which could increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse events. Darunavir co-administered with ritonavir with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s), potentially leading to loss of their therapeutic effect (see Table 10).








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Darunavir

Darunavir and ritonavir are metabolized by CYP3A. In vitro data indicate that darunavir may be a P-gp substrate. Drugs that induce CYP3A activity would be expected to increase the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir, resulting in lowered plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir. Co-administration of darunavir and ritonavir and other drugs that inhibit CYP3A, or P-gp may decrease the clearance of darunavir and ritonavir and may result in increased plasma concentrations of darunavir and ritonavir (see Table 10).








7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 10 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with darunavir/ritonavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of efficacy. The table includes examples of potentially significant interactions but is not all inclusive [see Contraindications (

Paclitaxel, when given prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride, increases the plasma-concentrations of doxorubicin and its metabolites. Administer Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection/for Injection prior to paclitaxel if used concomitantly. 










7.2	Concomitant Use of Trastuzumab

Concomitant use of trastuzumab and doxorubicin hydrochloride results in an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Avoid concomitant administration of Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Injection/for Injection and trastuzumab [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Patients receiving doxorubicin after stopping treatment with trastuzumab may also be at an increased risk of developing cardiotoxicity. Trastuzumab may persist in the circulation for up to 7 months. Therefore, avoid anthracycline-based therapy for up to 7 months after stopping trastuzumab when possible. If anthracyclines are used before this time, carefully monitor cardiac function.








7.3	Concomitant Use of Dexrazoxane

Do not administer dexrazoxane as a cardioprotectant at the initiation of doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing chemotherapy regimens. In a randomized trial in women with metastatic breast cancer, initiation of dexrazoxane with doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy resulted in a significantly lower tumor response rate (48% vs. 63%; p=0.007) and shorter time to progression compared to doxorubicin hydrochloride-based chemotherapy alone.

delayed-release tablets, for oral use

Initial U.S. Approval: 2006",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Posaconazole is primarily metabolized via UDP glucuronosyltransferase and is a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux. Therefore, inhibitors or inducers of these clearance pathways may affect posaconazole plasma concentrations. Coadministration of drugs that can decrease the plasma concentrations of posaconazole should generally be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk. If such drugs are necessary, patients should be monitored closely for breakthrough fungal infections.  
Posaconazole is also a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4. Therefore, plasma concentrations of drugs predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased by posaconazole

7.5 Benzodiazepines Metabolized by CYP3A4

Concomitant administration of posaconazole with midazolam increases the midazolam plasma concentrations by approximately 5-fold. Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects. Concomitant use of posaconazole and other benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam, triazolam) could result in increased plasma concentrations of these benzodiazepines. Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects

7.7 Rifabutin

Rifabutin induces UDP-glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations. Rifabutin is also metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of rifabutin with posaconazole increases rifabutin plasma concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. However, if concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections as well as frequent monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions due to increased rifabutin plasma concentrations (e.g., uveitis, leukopenia) are recommended.

 








7.8 Phenytoin

Phenytoin induces UDP-glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations. Phenytoin is also metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of phenytoin with posaconazole increases phenytoin plasma concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. However, if concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended and frequent monitoring of phenytoin concentrations should be performed while coadministered with posaconazole and dose reduction of phenytoin should be considered.

 








7.9 Gastric Acid Suppressors/Neutralizers

7.10 Vinca Alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.7

)].Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.

 








7.11 Calcium Channel Blockers Metabolized by CYP3A4

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, nicardipine, felodipine). Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of calcium channel blockers may be needed.








7.12 Digoxin

Increased plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported in patients receiving digoxin and posaconazole. Therefore, monitoring of digoxin plasma concentrations is recommended during coadministration.








7.13 Gastrointestinal Motility Agents

Concomitant administration of metoclopramide with posaconazole delayed-release tablets did not affect the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole

Increased plasma midazolam concentrations could potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects. Concomitant use of posaconazole and other benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam, triazolam) could result in increased plasma concentrations of these benzodiazepines. Patients must be monitored closely for adverse effects associated with high plasma concentrations of benzodiazepines metabolized by CYP3A4 and benzodiazepine receptor antagonists must be available to reverse these effects
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.6
) and Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].7.6 Anti-HIV Drugs


Efavirenz: Efavirenz induces UDP-glucuronidase and significantly decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. It is recommended to avoid concomitant use of efavirenz with posaconazole unless the benefit outweighs the risks.  

 

Ritonavir and Atazanavir: Ritonavir and atazanavir are metabolized by CYP3A4 and posaconazole increases plasma concentrations of these drugs
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].Frequent monitoring of adverse effects and toxicity of ritonavir and atazanavir should be performed during coadministration with posaconazole.  

 

Fosamprenavir: Combining fosamprenavir with posaconazole may lead to decreased posaconazole plasma concentrations. If concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].7.7 Rifabutin

Rifabutin induces UDP-glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations. Rifabutin is also metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of rifabutin with posaconazole increases rifabutin plasma concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. Concomitant use of posaconazole and rifabutin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. However, if concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections as well as frequent monitoring of full blood counts and adverse reactions due to increased rifabutin plasma concentrations (e.g., uveitis, leukopenia) are recommended.7.8 Phenytoin

Phenytoin induces UDP-glucuronidase and decreases posaconazole plasma concentrations. Phenytoin is also metabolized by CYP3A4. Therefore, coadministration of phenytoin with posaconazole increases phenytoin plasma concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. Concomitant use of posaconazole and phenytoin should be avoided unless the benefit to the patient outweighs the risk. However, if concomitant administration is required, close monitoring for breakthrough fungal infections is recommended and frequent monitoring of phenytoin concentrations should be performed while coadministered with posaconazole and dose reduction of phenytoin should be considered.7.9 Gastric Acid Suppressors/Neutralizers

No clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole were observed when posaconazole delayed-release tablets are concomitantly used with antacids, H
 
  2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].No dosage adjustment of posaconazole delayed-release tablets is required when concomitantly used with antacids, H
 
  2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors.7.10 Vinca Alkaloids

Most of the vinca alkaloids (e.g., vincristine and vinblastine) are substrates of CYP3A4. Concomitant administration of azole antifungals, including posaconazole, with vincristine has been associated with serious adverse reactions
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.7

)].Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of vinca alkaloids which may lead to neurotoxicity and other serious adverse reactions. Therefore, reserve azole antifungals, including posaconazole, for patients receiving a vinca alkaloid, including vincristine, who have no alternative antifungal treatment options.7.11 Calcium Channel Blockers Metabolized by CYP3A4

Posaconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., verapamil, diltiazem, nifedipine, nicardipine, felodipine). Frequent monitoring for adverse reactions and toxicity related to calcium channel blockers is recommended during coadministration. Dose reduction of calcium channel blockers may be needed.7.12 Digoxin

Increased plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported in patients receiving digoxin and posaconazole. Therefore, monitoring of digoxin plasma concentrations is recommended during coadministration.7.13 Gastrointestinal Motility Agents

Concomitant administration of metoclopramide with posaconazole delayed-release tablets did not affect the pharmacokinetics of posaconazole
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. No dosage adjustment of posaconazole delayed-release tablets is required when given concomitantly with metoclopramide.7.14 Glipizide

Although no dosage adjustment of glipizide is required, it is recommended to monitor glucose concentrations when posaconazole and glipizide are concomitantly used.7.16 Venetoclax

Concomitant use of venetoclax (a CYP3A4 substrate) with posaconazole increases venetoclax C

Table 2 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Alfentanil HCl Injection.


Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Alfentanil HCl Injection






Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of Alfentanil HCl Injection and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of alfentanil, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Alfentanil HCl Injection and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Alfentanil HCl Injection is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the alfentanil plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to alfentanil.




Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Alfentanil HCl Injection until stable drug effects are achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Alfentanil HCl Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.




Examples:

Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)




CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of Alfentanil HCl Injection and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of alfentanil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to alfentanil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the alfentanil plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.




Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the Alfentanil HCl Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Alfentanil HCl Injection dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.




Examples:

Rifampin,  carbamazepine, phenytoin




Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants




Clinical Impact:

Diazepam administered immediately prior to or in conjunction with high doses of Alfentanil HCl Injection may produce vasodilation and hypotension, and may result in delayed recovery. Both the magnitude and duration of central nervous system and cardiovascular effects may be enhanced when Alfentanil HCl Injection is administered in combination with other CNS depressants such as barbiturates, tranquilizers, opioids, or inhalation general anesthetics. Postoperative respiratory depression may be enhanced or prolonged by these agents.




Intervention:

Monitor patients receiving Alfentanil HCl Injection and benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants for hypotension patients and prolonged respiratory depression and sedation. In such cases of combined treatment, the dose of one or both agents should be reduced. Limited clinical experience indicates that requirements for volatile inhalation anesthetics are reduced by 30 to 50% for the first sixty (60) minutes following alfentanil induction. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Examples:

Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.




Serotonergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].




Intervention:

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Alfentanil HCl Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.




Examples:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).




Monoamine  Oxidase Inhibitors




Clinical Impact:

Severe and unpredictable potentiation of monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors has been reported rarely with alfentanil. MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]




Intervention:

When Alfentanil HCl Injection is administered to patients who have received MAO inhibitors within 14 days, monitor patients for hypertension and ensure ready availability of vasodilators and beta-blockers for the treatment of hypertension as needed.




Examples:

phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid




Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics




Clinical Impact:

May reduce the analgesic effect of Alfentanil HCl Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.




Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use.




Examples:

butorphanol,  nalbuphine,  pentazocine,  buprenorphine




Muscle Relaxants




Clinical Impact:

Alfentanil may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.




Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Alfentanil HCl Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.




Diuretics




Clinical Impact:

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.




Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.




Anticholinergic  Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.




Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Alfentanil HCl Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.




Cimetidine




Clinical Impact:

Cimetidine reduces the clearance of alfentanil, extending the duration of action.




Intervention:

Use smaller alfentanil doses for prolonged administration and monitor closely for respiratory depression and other effects of alfentanil.




Nitrous oxide




Clinical Impact:

Nitrous oxide has been reported to produce cardiovascular depression when given with higher doses of Alfentanil HCl Injection.




Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of cardiovascular depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.











Concomitant Use of CNS Depressants: May decrease pulmonary arterial pressure and may cause hypotension. See FPI for management instructions. For post-operative pain, start with the lowest effective dosage and monitor for potentiation of CNS depressant effects. (5.5, 7)


Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with Alfentanil HCl Injection because they may reduce analgesic effect of Alfentanil HCl Injection or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

ACE-Inhibitors and Angiotensin II Antagonists


Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. These interactions should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists. In some patients with compromised renal function (e.g., elderly patients or patients who are volume-depleted, including those on diuretic therapy) who are being treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the co-administration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible. Therefore, monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving ACEIs or AIIAs and NSAIDs in combination therapy.











Acetaminophen


Acetaminophen had no effect on the plasma levels of sulindac or its sulfide metabolite.











Aspirin


The concomitant administration of aspirin with sulindac significantly depressed the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite. A double-blind study compared the safety and efficacy of sulindac tablets 300 or 400 mg daily given alone or with aspirin 2.4 g/day for the treatment of osteoarthritis. The addition of aspirin did not alter the types of clinical or laboratory adverse experiences for sulindac tablets; however, the combination showed an increase in the incidence of gastrointestinal adverse experiences. Since the addition of aspirin did not have a favorable effect on the therapeutic response to sulindac tablets, the combination is not recommended.











Cyclosporine


Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.











Diflunisal


The concomitant administration of sulindac tablets and diflunisal in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.











Diuretics


Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that sulindac tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see
 
  

WARNINGS, Renal Effects
)
 
  , as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

 











DMSO


DMSO should not be used with sulindac. Concomitant administration has been reported to reduce the plasma levels of the active sulfide metabolite and potentially reduce efficacy. In addition, this combination has been reported to cause peripheral neuropathy.











Lithium


NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.











Methotrexate


NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.











NSAIDs


The concomitant use of sulindac tablets with other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy.











Oral anticoagulants


Although sulindac and its sulfide metabolite are highly bound to protein, studies in which sulindac tablets were given at a dose of 400 mg daily have shown no clinically significant interaction with oral anticoagulants. However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their anticoagulant dosage is required. Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels. The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.











Oral hypoglycemic agents


Although sulindac and its sulfide metabolite are highly bound to protein, studies in which sulindac tablets were given at a dose of 400 mg daily, have shown no clinically significant interaction with oral hypoglycemic agents. However, patients should be monitored carefully until it is certain that no change in their hypoglycemic dosage is required. Special attention should be paid to patients taking higher doses than those recommended and to patients with renal impairment or other metabolic defects that might increase sulindac blood levels.











Probenecid


Probenecid given concomitantly with sulindac had only a slight effect on plasma sulfide levels, while plasma levels of sulindac and sulfone were increased. Sulindac was shown to produce a modest reduction in the uricosuric action of probenecid, which probably is not significant under most circumstances.











Propoxyphene hydrochloride


Propoxyphene hydrochloride had no effect on the plasma levels of sulindac or its sulfide metabolite.","ACE-inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, acetaminophen, aspirin, cyclosporine, diflunisal, furosemide, thiazides, DMSO, lithium, methotrexate, NSAIDs, oral anticoagulants, warfarin, oral hypoglycemic agents, probenecid, propoxyphene hydrochloride"

See full prescribing information for NEVIRAPINE EXTENDED-RELEASE TABLETS. NEVIRAPINE extended-release tablets, for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 1996",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 

Nevirapine is principally metabolized by the liver via the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, 3A and 2B6. Nevirapine is known to be an inducer of these enzymes. As a result, drugs that are metabolized by these enzyme systems may have lower than expected plasma levels when co-administered with nevirapine.
The results of drug interactions studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets. The specific pharmacokinetic changes that occur with co-administration of nevirapine and other drugs are listed in 
Clinical Pharmacology
, Table 4. Clinical comments about possible dosage modifications based on established drug interactions are listed in Table 3. The data in Tables 3 and 4 are based on the results of drug interaction studies conducted in HIV-1 seropositive subjects unless otherwise indicated. In addition to established drug interactions, there may be potential pharmacokinetic interactions between nevirapine and other drug classes that are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. These potential drug interactions are also listed in Table 3. Although specific drug interaction studies in HIV-1 seropositive subjects have not been conducted for some classes of drugs listed in Table 3, additional clinical monitoring may be warranted when co-administering these drugs.
The in vitro interaction between nevirapine and the antithrombotic agent warfarin is complex. As a result, when giving these drugs concomitantly, plasma warfarin levels may change with the potential for increases in coagulation time. When warfarin is co-administered with nevirapine, anticoagulation levels should be monitored frequently.

Appropriate doses for this combination have not been established.





Antibiotics:
Clarithromycin



 ↓ Clarithromycin↑ 14-OH clarithromycin


 Clarithromycin exposure was significantly decreased by nevirapine; however, 14-OH metabolite concentrations were increased. Because clarithromycin active metabolite has reduced activity against Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, overall activity against this pathogen may be altered. Alternatives to clarithromycin, such as azithromycin, should be considered. 




Rifabutin



↑ Rifabutin


Rifabutin and its metabolite concentrations were moderately increased. Due to high intersubject variability, however, some patients may experience large increases in rifabutin exposure and may be at higher risk for rifabutin toxicity. Therefore, caution should be used in concomitant administration. 




Rifampin

Nevirapine and rifampin should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in nevirapine plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. Physicians needing to treat patients co-infected with tuberculosis and using a nevirapine-containing regimen may use rifabutin instead.





Anticonvulsants:
Carbamazepine, clonazepam, ethosuximide


Plasma concentrations of nevirapine and the anticonvulsant may be decreased.


Use with caution and monitor virologic response and levels of anticonvulsants.





Antifungals:
Fluconazole



 ↑ Nevirapine


 Because of the risk of increased exposure to nevirapine, caution should be used in concomitant administration, and patients should be monitored closely for nevirapine-associated adverse events. 




Ketoconazole



↓ Ketoconazole


Nevirapine and ketoconazole should not be administered concomitantly because decreases in ketoconazole plasma concentrations may reduce the efficacy of the drug. 




Itraconazole


↓ Itraconazole


Nevirapine and itraconazole should not be administered concomitantly due to potential decreases in itraconazole plasma concentrations that may reduce efficacy of the drug.

Oral Contraceptives:
Ethinyl Estradiol and Norethindrone



 ↓ Ethinyl Estradiol ↓ Norethindrone 


 Despite lower ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone exposures when co-administered with nevirapine, literature reports suggest that nevirapine has no effect on pregnancy rates among HIV-infected women on combined oral contraceptives. When co-administered with nevirapine extended-release tablets, no dose adjustment of ethinyl estradiol or norethindrone is needed when used in combination for contraception.
 
When oral contraceptives are used for hormonal regulation during nevirapine extended-release tablet therapy, the therapeutic effect of the hormonal therapy should be monitored.




 





Co-administration of nevirapine extended-release tablets can alter the concentrations of other drugs, and other drugs may alter the concentration of nevirapine. The potential for drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (5.4, 7, 12.3)Drug Interactions




[See Drug Interactions (7).]

Nevirapine induces hepatic cytochrome P450 metabolic isoenzymes 3A and 2B6. Co-administration of nevirapine extended-release tablets and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2B6 may result in decreased plasma concentrations of these drugs and attenuate their therapeutic effects.
While primarily an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A and 2B6 enzymes, nevirapine may also inhibit this system. Among human hepatic cytochrome P450s, nevirapine was capable in vitro of inhibiting the 10-hydroxylation of (R)-warfarin (CYP3A). The estimated Ki for the inhibition of CYP3A was 270 micromolar, a concentration that is unlikely to be achieved in patients as the therapeutic range is less than 25 micromolar. Therefore, nevirapine may have minimal inhibitory effect on other substrates of CYP3A.
Nevirapine does not appear to affect the plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates of other CYP450 enzyme systems, such as 1A2, 2D6, 2A6, 2E1, 2C9, or 2C19.
Table 4 (see below) contains the results of drug interaction trials performed with immediate-release nevirapine and other drugs likely to be co-administered. The effects of nevirapine on the AUC, Cmax, and Cmin of co-administered drugs are summarized. Results of drug interaction studies with immediate-release nevirapine are expected to also apply to nevirapine extended-release tablets.

§




Because of the design of the drug interaction trials (addition of 28 days of nevirapine therapy to existing HIV-1 therapy), the effect of the concomitant drug on plasma nevirapine steady-state concentrations was estimated by comparison to historical controls.
Administration of rifampin had a clinically significant effect on nevirapine pharmacokinetics, decreasing AUC and Cmax by greater than 50%. Administration of fluconazole resulted in an approximate 100% increase in nevirapine exposure, based on a comparison to historic data [see Drug Interactions (7)]. The effect of other drugs listed in Table 4 on nevirapine pharmacokinetics was not significant. No significant interaction was observed when tipranavir was co-administered with low-dose ritonavir and nevirapine.","Atazanavir, Ritonavir, Fosamprenavir, Indinavir, Lopinavir, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Efavirenz, Etravirine, Rilpivirine, Methadone, Amiodarone, Disopyramide, Lidocaine, Clarithromycin, Rifabutin, Rifampin, Carbamazepine, Clonazepam, Ethosuximide, Fluconazole, Ketoconazole, Itraconazole, Warfarin, Diltiazem, Nifedipine, Verapamil, Cyclophosphamide, Ergotamine, Cyclosporine, Tacrolimus, Sirolimus, Cisapride, Fentanyl, Ethinyl Estradiol, Norethindrone"

Effect of Other Drugs on DAYVIGO




Strong, Moderate, and Weak CYP3A Inhibitors




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use with a strong, moderate, or weak CYP3A inhibitor increases lemborexant AUC and Cmax which may increase the risk of DAYVIGO adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].




Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors [see Dosage and Administration (

2.2

)].
The maximum recommended dose of DAYVIGO with weak CYP3A inhibitors is 5 mg [see Dosage and Administration (

2.2

)].




Examples:

Strong CYP3A inhibitors: itraconazole, clarithromycinModerate CYP3A inhibitors: fluconazole, verapamilWeak CYP3A inhibitors: chlorzoxazone, ranitidine



Strong and Moderate CYP3A Inducers




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use with a strong or moderate CYP3A inducer decreases lemborexant exposure, which may reduce DAYVIGO efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].




Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers [see Dosage and Administration (

2.2

)].




Examples:

Strong CYP3A inducers: rifampin, carbamazepine, St. John’s wortModerate CYP3A inducers: bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil



Alcohol




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of alcohol increases lemborexant Cmax and AUC. Co-administration of DAYVIGO with alcohol produced a numerically greater negative impact on postural stability and memory as compared with alcohol alone when assessed near the tmax of DAYVIGO (2 hours post-dose) [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.2

)].




Intervention:

Avoid alcohol consumption with DAYVIGO [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.1

)].

CYP2B6 Substrates




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of DAYVIGO decreases the AUC of drugs that are CYP2B6 substrates, which may result in reduced efficacy for these concomitant medications [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)].




Intervention:

Patients receiving DAYVIGO and CYP2B6 substrates concurrently should be monitored for adequate clinical response. Increasing the doses of CYP2B6 substrates may be considered as needed.

Certain CYP450 Substrates

Increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., IL-17) during chronic inflammation associated with certain diseases including PsO, PsA, AS, nr-axSpA, ERA, and HS may suppress the formation of CYP enzymes.
Upon initiation or discontinuation of COSENTYX in patients who are receiving concomitant CYP450 substrates, particularly those where minimal decreases in the concentration may reduce CYP substrate effectiveness or minimal increases in the concentration may increase CYP substrate adverse reactions, consider monitoring for therapeutic effect or concentration of the CYP substrate and consider dosage adjustment of the CYP substrate as needed [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",""

7.1 Strong CYP2D6 Inhibitors


In vitrostudies indicate that α-HTBZ and β-HTBZ are substrates for CYP2D6. Strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, quinidine) markedly increase exposure to these metabolites. A reduction in tetrabenazine dose may be necessary when adding a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (e.g., fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine) in patients maintained on a stable dose of tetrabenazine. The daily dose of tetrabenazine should not exceed 50 mg per day and the maximum single dose of tetrabenazine should not exceed 25 mg in patients taking strong CYP2D6 inhibitors

7.2 Reserpine

Reserpine binds irreversibly to VMAT2, and the duration of its effect is several days. Prescribers should wait for chorea to re-emerge before administering tetrabenazine to avoid overdosage and major depletion of serotonin and norepinephrine in the CNS. At least 20 days should elapse after stopping reserpine before starting tetrabenazine. Tetrabenazine and reserpine should not be used concomitantly
 
  [see

   4)
 
  
].

 








7.3 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)

Tetrabenazine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs. Tetrabenazine should not be used in combination with an MAOI, or within a minimum of 14 days of discontinuing therapy with an MAOI
 
  [see
Contraindications (
  
   4)
 
  
].

 








7.4 Alcohol or Other Sedating Drugs

Concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs may have additive effects and worsen sedation and somnolence
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.7)].
 
  









7.5 Drugs that Cause QTc Prolongation

Tetrabenazine causes a small prolongation of QTc (about 8 msec), concomitant use with other drugs that are known to cause QTc prolongation should be avoided, these including antipsychotic medications (e.g., chlorpromazine, haloperidol, thioridazine, ziprasidone), antibiotics (e.g., moxifloxacin), Class 1A (e.g., quinidine, procainamide) and Class III (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications or any other medications known to prolong the QTc interval. Tetrabenazine should be avoided in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias. Certain conditions may increase the risk for torsade de pointes or sudden death such as (1) bradycardia; (2) hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; (3) concomitant use of other drugs that prolong the QTc interval; and (4) presence of congenital prolongation of the QT interval

Use with caution in patients taking potent, chronic cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir). (7)







7.1 Cytochrome P450 3A Inhibitors

Dutasteride is extensively metabolized in humans by the cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4 and CYP3A5 isoenzymes. The effect of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors on dutasteride has not been studied. Because of the potential for drug-drug interactions, use caution when prescribing dutasteride to patients taking potent, chronic CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Alpha-adrenergic Antagonists

The administration of dutasteride in combination with tamsulosin or terazosin has no effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either alpha-adrenergic antagonist. The effect of administration of tamsulosin or terazosin on dutasteride pharmacokinetic parameters has not been evaluated.








7.3 Calcium Channel Antagonists

Coadministration of verapamil or diltiazem decreases dutasteride clearance and leads to increased exposure to dutasteride. The change in dutasteride exposure is not considered to be clinically significant. No dose adjustment is recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.4 Cholestyramine

Administration of a single 5-mg dose of dutasteride followed 1 hour later by 12 g of cholestyramine does not affect the relative bioavailability of dutasteride [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g., spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g., heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and in heart failure patients to increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.








7.2 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.  These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.








7.3 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy
 
  [

see Clinical Studies14.3

]. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on valsartan and other agents that affect the RAS.

 
Do not coadminister aliskiren with valsartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with valsartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 mL/min).








7.4 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan.

Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets can potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, alpha- blockers, and antihypertensives. (
          
  
     7.1)
         
 
    








7.1 Potential for Pharmacodynamic Interactions with Vardenafil Hydrochloride Tablets







Nitrates: Concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets and nitrates and nitric oxide donors is contraindicated. The blood pressure lowering effects of sublingual nitrates (0.4 mg) taken 1 and 4 hours after vardenafil and increases in heart rate when taken at 1, 4 and 8 hours after vardenafil were potentiated by a 20 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in healthy middle-aged subjects. These effects were not observed when vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg were taken 24 hours before the nitroglycerin (NTG). Potentiation of the hypotensive effects of nitrates for patients with ischemic heart disease has not been evaluated, and concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets and nitrates is contraindicated

   Contraindications (4.1) and 
            
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)
.
          

 










Alpha-Blockers: Caution is advised when PDE5 inhibitors are co-administered with alpha-blockers. PDE5 inhibitors, including vardenafil hydrochloride tablets and alpha-adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with co-administration of vardenafil with alfuzosin, terazosin or tamsulosin.

   Clinical Pharmacology (12.2).]
           
 
  











Antihypertensives: Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets may add to the blood pressure lowering effects of antihypertensive agents. In a clinical pharmacology study of patients with erectile dysfunction, single doses of vardenafil 20 mg caused a mean maximum decrease in supine blood pressure of 7 mmHg systolic and 8 mmHg diastolic (compared to placebo), accompanied by a mean maximum increase of heart rate of 4 beats per minute. The maximum decrease in blood pressure occurred between 1 and 4 hours after dosing. Following multiple dosing for 31 days, similar blood pressure responses were observed on Day 31 as on Day 1.
          

 










Alcohol: Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets (20 mg) did not potentiate the hypotensive effects of alcohol during the 4-hour observation period in healthy volunteers when administered with alcohol (0.5 g/kg body weight, approximately 40 mL of absolute alcohol in a 70 kg person). Alcohol and vardenafil plasma levels were not altered when dosed simultaneously.
          

 










7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on Vardenafil







In vitro studies

Studies in human liver microsomes showed that vardenafil is metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms 3A4/5, and to a lesser degree by CYP2C9. Therefore, inhibitors of these enzymes are expected to reduce vardenafil clearance 
           
 
  [see 
            
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.4) and 
            
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
           
 
  .
          

 










In vivo studies









Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors

Ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) produced a 10-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 4-fold increase in maximum concentration (C
             
 
  max) when co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets (5 mg) in healthy volunteers. A 5-mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablet dose should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with 200 mg once daily ketoconazole. Since higher doses of ketoconazole (400 mg daily) may result in higher increases in C
             
 
  max and AUC, a single 2.5 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should not be exceeded in a 24-hour period when used in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg daily. 
             
 
  [See 
              
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.4) and 
              
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5).]
             
 
  

Indinavir (800 mg t.i.d.) co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 10 mg resulted in a 16-fold increase in vardenafil AUC, a 7-fold increase in vardenafil C
             
 
  max and a 2-fold increase in vardenafil half-life. It is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets dose in a 24-hour period when used in combination with indinavir. 
             
 
  [See 
              
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.4) and 
              
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.2).]
             
 
  

Ritonavir (600 mg b.i.d.) co-administered with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg resulted in a 49-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 13­ fold increase in vardenafil C
             
 
  max. The interaction is a consequence of blocking hepatic metabolism of vardenafil by ritonavir, a HIV protease inhibitor and a highly strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, which also inhibits CYP2C9. Ritonavir significantly prolonged the half-life of vardenafil to 26 hours. Consequently, it is recommended not to exceed a single 2.5 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets dose in a 72-hour period when used in combination with ritonavir. 
             
 
  [See

  .
            

 
Cobicistat with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets can result in increased plasma concentrations, therefore it is recommended that a single 2.5 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets should not be exceeded in a 72-hour period.

  .
            

 










Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors

Erythromycin (500 mg t.i.d.) produced a 4-fold increase in vardenafil AUC and a 3-fold increase in C
             
 
  max when co­ administered with vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 5 mg in healthy volunteers. It is recommended not to exceed a single 5 mg dose of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in a 24-hour period when used in combination with erythromycin. 
             
 
  [See 
              
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.4) and 
              
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5).]
             
 
  

Although specific interactions have not been studied, other CYP3A4 inhibitors, including grapefruit juice would likely increase vardenafil exposure.












Other Drug Interactions

No pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between vardenafil and the following drugs: glyburide, warfarin, digoxin, an antacid based on magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, and ranitidine. In the warfarin study, vardenafil had no effect on the prothrombin time or other pharmacodynamic parameters.
Cimetidine (400 mg b.i.d.) had no effect on vardenafil bioavailability (AUC) and maximum concentration (C
           
 
  max) of vardenafil when co-administered with 20 mg vardenafil hydrochloride tablets in healthy volunteers.
          

 










7.3 Effects of Vardenafil on Other Drugs







In vitro studies

Vardenafil and its metabolites had no effect on CYP1A2, 2A6, and 2E1 (Ki >100 micromolar). Weak inhibitory effects toward other isoforms (CYP2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4) were found, but Ki values were in excess of plasma concentrations achieved following dosing. The most potent inhibitory activity was observed for vardenafil metabolite M1, which had a Ki of 1.4 micromolar toward CYP3A4, which is about 20 times higher than the M1 C
           
 
  max values after an 80 mg vardenafil dose.
          

 
In vitro data suggest that vardenafil has the potential to inhibit P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at therapeutic doses. While concomitant use of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets did not significantly increase plasma concentrations of digoxin, a P-gp substrate, the effect on plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates that are more sensitive than digoxin (e.g. dabigatran) is not known.
 










In vivo studies









Nifedipine: Vardenafil 20 mg, when co-administered with slow-release nifedipine 30 mg or 60 mg once daily, did not affect the AUC or C
             
 
  max of nifedipine, a drug that is metabolized via CYP3A4. Nifedipine did not alter the plasma levels of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets when taken in combination. In these patients whose hypertension was controlled with nifedipine, vardenafil hydrochloride tablets 20 mg produced mean additional supine systolic/diastolic blood pressure reductions of 6/5 mmHg compared to placebo.
            

 










Ritonavir and Indinavir: Upon concomitant administration of 5 mg of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets with 600 mg BID ritonavir, the C
             
 
  max and AUC of ritonavir were reduced by approximately 20%. Upon administration of 10 mg of vardenafil hydrochloride tablets with 800 mg TID indinavir, the C
             
 
  max and AUC of indinavir were reduced by 40% and 30%, respectively.
            

 










Aspirin: Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) did not potentiate the increase in bleeding time caused by aspirin (two 81 mg tablets).
            

 










Other interactions: Vardenafil hydrochloride tablets had no effect on the pharmacodynamics of glyburide (glucose and insulin concentrations) and warfarin (prothrombin time or other pharmacodynamic parameters).","Nitrates, nitric oxide donors, alfuzosin, terazosin, tamsulosin, ketoconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, glyburide, warfarin, digoxin, antacid based on magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, ranitidine, cimetidine, nifedipine, aspirin"

7.1 Depolarizing Muscle relaxants

Use of neostigmine to reverse the effects of depolarizing muscle relaxants such as succinylcholine is not recommended, because it may prolong the phase-1 block.   








7.2 Antibiotics

Certain antibiotics, particularly neomycin, streptomycin and kanamycin have nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking action, and therefore, neostigmine dose adjustments may be required to reverse neuromuscular block in patients who have been taking these drugs.  There was no effect on neostigmine action on rocuronium reversal by cefuroxime, metronidazole, cefuroxime or metronidazole.","succinylcholine, neomycin, streptomycin, kanamycin, rocuronium, cefuroxime, metronidazole"

In studies of in vivo pharmacokinetic drug interactions, no interaction was seen between acitretin and cimetidine, digoxin, phenprocoumon, or glyburide.


Ethanol:


Clinical evidence has shown that etretinate (a retinoid with a much longer half-life, see below) can be formed with concurrent ingestion of acitretin and ethanol. In a 2-way crossover trial, all 10 subjects formed etretinate with concurrent ingestion of a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin during a 3-hour period of ethanol ingestion (total ethanol, approximately 1.4 g per kg body weight). A mean peak etretinate concentration of 59 ng per mL (range: 22 to 105 ng per mL) was observed, and extrapolation of AUC values indicated that the formation of etretinate in this trial was comparable to a single 5-mg oral dose of etretinate. There was no detectable formation of etretinate when a single 100-mg oral dose of acitretin was administered without concurrent ethanol ingestion, although the formation of etretinate without concurrent ethanol ingestion cannot be excluded (see boxed 
         
 
  
         
 
  CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS). Of 93 evaluable psoriatic subjects on acitretin therapy in several foreign trials (10 to 80 mg per day), 16% had measurable etretinate levels (>5 ng per mL).
        

 
        

 
Etretinate has a much longer elimination half-life compared with that of acitretin. In one trial the apparent mean terminal half-life after 6 months of therapy was approximately 120 days (range: 84 to 168 days). In another trial of 47 subjects treated chronically with etretinate, 5 had detectable serum drug levels (in the range of 0.5 to 12 ng per mL) 2.1 to 2.9 years after therapy was discontinued. The long half-life appears to be due to storage of etretinate in adipose tissue.


Progestin-only Contraceptives:

Other literature reported that co-administration of disulfiram increased AUC of plasma cocaine by several fold after intravenous cocaine administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  12.3)].
 

Avoid using COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE nasal solution in patients taking disulfiram. Consider using other local anesthetic agents.









7.2 Epinephrine, Phenylephrine


There are reports in the published literature of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, and ventricular arrhythmias after concomitant administration of topical intranasal cocaine with epinephrine and phenylephrine during nasal and sinus surgery.

Avoid use of additional vasoconstrictor agents such as epinephrine and phenylephrine with COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE nasal solution during nasal and sinus surgery. If concomitant use is unavoidable, prolonged vital sign and ECG monitoring may be required [see Warnings and Precautions (
  5.3)].
 









7.3 Inhibitors of plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase)


Cocaine has been described in literature to be primarily metabolized and inactivated by non-enzymatic ester hydrolysis and hepatic carboxylesterase, and also by plasma cholinesterase, hepatic carboxylesterase, and CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  12.3)]. The pharmacokinetics of COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE nasal solution in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity has not been studied.
 

Plasma cholinesterase activity may be decreased by chronic administration of certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, oral contraceptives, or glucocorticoids. It may also be diminished by administration of irreversible plasma cholinesterase inhibitors such as echothiophate, organophosphate insecticides, and certain antineoplastic agents. Patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase) activity may have reduced clearance and increased exposure of plasma cocaine after administration of COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE nasal solution

Since cocaine is metabolized by multiple enzymes, the effect of reduced plasma cholinesterase activity on cocaine exposure may be limited. No dosage adjustment of COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE nasal solution is needed in patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase. Monitor patients with reduced plasma cholinesterase activity for adverse reactions such as headache, epistaxis, and clinically- relevant increases in heart rate or blood pressure.","Disulfiram,Epinephrine,Phenylephrine,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors,Oral contraceptives,Glucocorticoids,Echothiophate,Organophosphate insecticides,Certain antineoplastic agents"

Opioids decrease the Minimum Alveolar Concentration (MAC) of isoflurane. Opioids such as fentanyl and its analogues, when combined with isoflurane, may lead to a synergistic fall in blood pressure and respiratory rate.
Nitrous oxide decreases the MAC of isoflurane (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).  
Isoflurane potentiates the muscle relaxant effect of all muscle relaxants and decreases the required doses of neuromuscular blocking agents. In general, anesthetic concentrations of isoflurane at equilibrium reduce the ED95 of succinylcholine, atracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium by approximately 25 to 40% or more compared to N2O/opioid anesthesia. If added relaxation is required, supplemental doses of muscle relaxants may be used.
Isoflurane is similar to sevoflurane in the sensitization of the myocardium to arrhythmogenic effect of exogenously administered adrenaline. Doses of adrenaline greater than 5mcg/kg, when administered submucosally may produce multiple ventricular arrhythmias. Isoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists.

7.1 Methotrexate

Adalimumab has been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients taking concomitant methotrexate (MTX). Although MTX reduced the apparent clearance of adalimumab, the data do not suggest the need for dose adjustment of either ABRILADA or MTX [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Biological Products

In clinical studies in patients with RA, an increased risk of serious infections has been observed with the combination of TNF blockers with anakinra or abatacept, with no added benefit; therefore, use of ABRILADA with abatacept or anakinra is not recommended in patients with RA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7, 5.11)]. A higher rate of serious infections has also been observed in patients with RA treated with rituximab who received subsequent treatment with a TNF blocker. There is insufficient information regarding the concomitant use of ABRILADA and other biologic products for the treatment of RA, PsA, AS, CD, UC, Ps, HS and UV. Concomitant administration of ABRILADA with other biologic DMARDS (e.g., anakinra and abatacept) or other TNF blockers is not recommended based upon the possible increased risk for infections and other potential pharmacological interactions.

The formation of CYP450 enzymes may be suppressed by increased concentrations of cytokines (e.g., TNFα, IL-6) during chronic inflammation. It is possible for products that antagonize cytokine activity, such as adalimumab products, to influence the formation of CYP450 enzymes. Upon initiation or discontinuation of ABRILADA in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, monitoring of the effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) is recommended and the individual dose of the drug product may be adjusted as needed.","Abatacept,Anakinra,Live vaccines,Rituximab,Methotrexate,Warfarin,Cyclosporine,Theophylline"

7.1	Immunosuppressive or Immune-Modulating Therapies 

The concomitant use of OCREVUS and other immune-modulating or immunosuppressive therapies, including immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids, is expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression. Consider the risk of additive immune system effects when coadministering immunosuppressive therapies with OCREVUS. When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, such as daclizumab, fingolimod, natalizumab, teriflunomide, or mitoxantrone, consider the duration and mode of action of these drugs because of additive immunosuppressive effects when initiating OCREVUS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].









7.2 Vaccinations

A Phase 3b randomized, open-label study examined the concomitant use of OCREVUS and several non-live vaccines in adults 18-55 years of age with relapsing forms of MS (68 subjects undergoing treatment with OCREVUS at the time of vaccination and 34 subjects not undergoing treatment with OCREVUS at the time of vaccination).

Intravenous adenosine has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. Digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenosine (see 
WARNINGS
). Because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the SA and AV nodes, however, adenosine should be used with caution in the presence of these agents. The use of adenosine in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation (see 
WARNINGS
).

The effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline. In the presence of these methylxanthines, larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective. Adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole. Thus, smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole. Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents. As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the A-V node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine.","quinidine, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, verapamil, digitalis, caffeine, theophylline, dipyridamole, carbamazepine"

Table 3: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Coadministered with Dexlansoprazole and Interactions with Diagnostics








Antiretrovirals






Clinical Impact:



The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.

Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.
Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with dexlansoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs.
There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with dexlansoprazole.






Intervention:




Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with dexlansoprazole is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)]. See prescribing information.

Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information.

Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with dexlansoprazole. See prescribing information for nelfinavir.

Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities.

Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information.





Warfarin






Clinical Impact:



Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.





Intervention:



Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].






Intervention:



A temporary withdrawal of dexlansoprazole may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



Potential for increased exposure of digoxin.





Intervention:



Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin.





Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole)






Clinical Impact:



Dexlansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.





Intervention:



Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Coadministration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving dexlansoprazole and MMF. Use dexlansoprazole with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF.
See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.





Tacrolimus






Clinical Impact:



Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.





Intervention:



Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus.





Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors






Clinical Impact:



CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].






Intervention:



Temporarily stop dexlansoprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.





Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test






Clinical Impact:



Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.





Intervention:



Temporarily stop dexlansoprazole treatment at least 30 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].






False Positive Urine Tests for THC






Clinical Impact:



There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.





Intervention:



An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection






Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants






Clinical Impact:



Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see 
Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.
].





Intervention:



Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Monitor patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.





Examples:



Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.





Examples:



Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].






Intervention:



The use of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment. 
If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.





Examples:



phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics






Clinical Impact:



May reduce the analgesic effect of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.





Intervention:



Avoid concomitant use.





Examples:



butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine,





Muscle Relaxants






Clinical Impact:



Hydromorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.





Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Hydromorphone Hydrochloride Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.

Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. 
    (7)








7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs

Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans 
  [see 
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
  Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline.
 
A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity 
  [see 
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
  Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine 
  [see 
   Contraindications (4)]. 
  









7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs

Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy.








7.3 
 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies


Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine 
  [see

Dual inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system: Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia. (7)
Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity. (7)







7.1	Non-steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or who have compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including azilsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving azilsartan and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including azilsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.








7.2	Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on Edarbi and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not coadminister aliskiren with Edarbi in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with Edarbi in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).

Table 3 includes a list of drugs with clinically important drug interactions when administered concomitantly with SKYTROFA and instructions for preventing or managing them.

Table 3:	Clinically Important Drug Interactions with SKYTROFA





Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment




Clinical Impact:

Microsomal enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1) is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Somatropin inhibits 11βHSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated growth hormone deficiency (GHD) have relative increases in 11βHSD-1 and serum cortisol. Initiation of SKYTROFA may result in inhibition of 11βHSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations.



Intervention:

Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SKYTROFA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]




Examples

Cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.



Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment




Clinical Impact:

Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth-promoting effects of SKYTROFA in pediatric patients.



Intervention:

Carefully adjust glucocorticoid replacement dosing in pediatric patients receiving glucocorticoid treatments to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth.



Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs




Clinical Impact:

Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated antipyrine clearance. SKYTROFA may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.



Intervention:

Careful monitoring is advisable when SKYTROFA is administered in combination with drugs metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.



Oral Estrogen




Clinical Impact:

Oral estrogens may reduce the serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) response to SKYTROFA.



Intervention:

Patients receiving oral estrogen replacement may require higher SKYTROFA dosages.



Insulin and/or Other Antihyperglycemic Agents




Clinical Impact:

Treatment with SKYTROFA may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses.



Intervention:

Patients with diabetes mellitus may require adjustment of their doses of insulin and/or other antihyperglycemic agents [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].









Replacement Glucocorticoid Treatment: Patients treated with glucocorticoid for hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of SKYTROFA (7).
Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment: Adjust glucocorticoid dosing in pediatric patients to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth (7).
Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs: SKYTROFA may alter the clearance. Monitor carefully if used with SKYTROFA (7).
Oral Estrogen: Larger doses of SKYTROFA may be required (7).

Caution should be exercised when the following drugs are administered concomitantly with
 carbidopa given with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products. 
Symptomatic postural hypotension has occurred when carbidopa, given with levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products, was added to the treatment of a patient receiving antihypertensive drugs. Therefore, when therapy with carbidopa, given with or without levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products, is started, dosage adjustment of the antihypertensive drug may be required.
For patients receiving monoamine oxidase inhibitors (Type A or B), see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
. Concomitant therapy with selegiline or rasigiline and carbidopa and carbidopa-levodopa may be associated with severe orthostatic hypotension not attributable to carbidopa-levodopa alone (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
).
There have been rare reports of adverse reactions, including hypertension and dyskinesia, resulting from the concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants and carbidopa-levodopa preparations.
Dopamine D2 receptor antagonists (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone) and isoniazid may reduce the therapeutic effects of levodopa. In addition, the beneficial effects of levodopa in Parkinson's disease have been reported to be reversed by phenytoin and papaverine. Patients taking these drugs with carbidopa and levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa combination products should be carefully observed for loss of therapeutic response.
Carbidopa and iron salts or multi vitamins containing iron salts should be co administered with caution. Iron salts can form chelates with levodopa and carbidopa and consequently reduce the bioavailability of carbidopa and levodopa.
Although metoclopramide may increase the bioavailability of levodopa by increasing gastric emptying, metoclopramide may also adversely affect disease control by its dopamine receptor antagonistic properties.","antihypertensive drugs, selegiline, rasigiline, tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, risperidone, isoniazid, phenytoin, papaverine, iron salts, multi vitamins containing iron salts, metoclopramide"

MAO Inhibitors





 


MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolite of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.

 




Serotonergic Drugs






 



The concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS). Examples of serotonergic drugs include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John’s Wort.

 




CYP2D6 Inhibitors






 



The concomitant use of dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets and CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the exposure of dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets compared to the use of the drug alone and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome particularly during dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets initiation and after a dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets and the CYP2D6 inhibitor (see WARNINGS, OVERDOSAGE).

 



Acidifying Agents


Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase the concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.

 



Adrenergic Blockers


Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.

 



Alkalinizing Agents


Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the actions of amphetamines.

 



Antidepressants, Tricyclic


Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.

 


 


 



Antihistamines


Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.

 



Antihypertensives


Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.

 



Chlorpromazine


Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.

 



Ethosuximide


Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.

 



Haloperidol


Haloperidol blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamines.

 



Lithium Carbonate


The stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.

 



Meperidine


Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.

 



Methenamine Therapy


Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced, by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.

 



Norepinephrine


Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.

 



Phenobarbital


Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenobarbital; coadministration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.

 



Phenytoin


Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; coadministration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.

 



Propoxyphene

nly",DI,"Drug Interactions:


When tamoxifen is used in combination with coumarin-type anticoagulants, a significant increase in anticoagulant effect may occur. Where such coadministration exists, careful monitoring of the patient's prothrombin time is recommended.
In the NSABP P-1 trial, women who required coumarin-type anticoagulants for any reason were ineligible for participation in the trial (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
).
There is an increased risk of thromboembolic events occurring when cytotoxic agents are used in combination with tamoxifen.
Tamoxifen reduced letrozole plasma concentrations by 37%. The effect of tamoxifen on metabolism and excretion of other antineoplastic drugs, such as cyclophosphamide and other drugs that require mixed function oxidases for activation, is not known. Tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations have been shown to be reduced when coadministered with rifampin or aminoglutethimide. Induction of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism is considered to be the mechanism by which these reductions occur; other CYP3A4 inducing agents have not been studied to confirm this effect.
One patient receiving tamoxifen with concomitant phenobarbital exhibited a steady-state serum level of tamoxifen lower than that observed for other patients (i.e., 26 ng/mL vs. mean value of 122 ng/mL). However, the clinical significance of this finding is not known. Rifampin induced the metabolism of tamoxifen and significantly reduced the plasma concentrations of tamoxifen in 10 patients. Aminoglutethimide reduces tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen plasma concentrations. Medroxyprogesterone reduces plasma concentrations of N-desmethyl, but not tamoxifen.
Concomitant bromocriptine therapy has been shown to elevate serum tamoxifen and N-desmethyl tamoxifen.
Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the anastrozole adjuvant trial, tamoxifen citrate should not be administered with anastrozole (see

400 mg and 600 mg",DI,"Drug Interactions 

Adding a drug that inhibits theophylline metabolism (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin, tacrine) or stopping a concurrently administered drug that enhances theophylline metabolism (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin). (see 
         
 
  PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions, Table II).
        

 








When Signs or Symptoms of Theophylline Toxicity Are Present





Whenever a patient receiving theophylline develops nausea or vomiting, particularly repetitive vomiting, or other signs or symptoms consistent with theophylline toxicity (even if another cause may be suspected), additional doses of theophylline should be withheld and a serum theophylline concentration measured immediately. 
           
 
  Patients should be instructed not to continue any dosage that causes adverse effects and to withhold subsequent doses until the symptoms have resolved, at which time the healthcare professional may instruct the patient to resume the drug at a lower dosage (see 
           
 
  DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Dosing Guidelines, Table VI).Drug Interactions 

Theophylline interacts with a wide variety of drugs. The interaction may be pharmacodynamic, i.e., alterations in the therapeutic response to theophylline or another drug or occurrence of adverse effects without a change in serum theophylline concentration. More frequently, however, the interaction is pharmacokinetic, i.e., the rate of theophylline clearance is altered by another drug resulting in increased or decreased serum theophylline concentrations. Theophylline only rarely alters the pharmacokinetics of other drugs.
The drugs listed in Table II have the potential to produce clinically significant pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic interactions with theophylline. The information in the “Effect” column of Table II assumes that the interacting drug is being added to a steady-state theophylline regimen. If theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that inhibits theophylline clearance (e.g., cimetidine, erythromycin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be smaller. Conversely, if theophylline is being initiated in a patient who is already taking a drug that enhances theophylline clearance (e.g., rifampin), the dose of theophylline required to achieve a therapeutic serum theophylline concentration will be larger. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that increases theophylline clearance will result in accumulation of theophylline to potentially toxic levels, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately reduced. Discontinuation of a concomitant drug that inhibits theophylline clearance will result in decreased serum theophylline concentrations, unless the theophylline dose is appropriately increased.
The drugs listed in Table III have either been documented not to interact with theophylline or do not produce a clinically significant interaction (i.e., < 15% change in theophylline clearance).
The listing of drugs in Table II and III are current as of February 9, 1995. New interactions are continuously being reported for theophylline, especially with new chemical entities. 
         
 
  
The healthcare professional should not assume that a drug does not interact with theophylline if it is not listed in Table II.
Before addition of a newly available drug in a patient receiving theophylline, the package insert of the new drug and/or the medical literature should be consulted to determine if an interaction between the new drug and theophylline has been reported.

7.3 Effect of Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors and Inducers


In vitro studies of human hepatic microsomes showed that treprostinil does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A. Additionally, treprostinil does not induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A.
Human pharmacokinetic studies with an oral formulation of treprostinil (treprostinil diolamine) indicated that co-administration of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 enzyme inhibitor, gemfibrozil, increases exposure (both Cmax and AUC) to treprostinil. Co-administration of the CYP2C8 enzyme inducer, rifampin, decreases exposure to treprostinil. It is unclear if the safety and efficacy of treprostinil by the inhalation route are altered by inhibitors or inducers of CYP2C8 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Table 7: Drug Interactions that Affect BALVERSA





Moderate CYP2C9 or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors



Clinical Impact


Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations
      
       [see
       
        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      
       

Increased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to increased drug-related toxicity
      
       [see
       
        Warnings and Precautions (5)].
      
       





Clinical Management


Consider alternative therapies that are not moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during treatment with BALVERSA.
If co-administration of a moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, monitor closely for adverse reactions and consider dose modifications accordingly
      
       [see
       
        Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
      
       If the moderate CYP2C9 or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, resume the BALVERSA dose before dose modifications in the absence of drug-related toxicity.
     
      





Strong CYP3A4 Inducers



Clinical Impact


Co-administration of BALVERSA with strong CYP3A4 inducers decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations
      
       [see
       
        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      
       

Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity.




Clinical Management


Avoid co-administration of strong CYP3A4 inducers with BALVERSA.





Moderate CYP3A4 Inducers



Clinical Impact


Co-administration of BALVERSA with moderate CYP3A4 inducers may decrease erdafitinib plasma concentrations
      
       [see
       
        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      
       

Decreased erdafitinib plasma concentrations may lead to decreased activity.




Clinical Management


If a moderate CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered at the start of BALVERSA treatment, administer BALVERSA at a dose of 9 mg daily.
When a moderate CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, continue BALVERSA at the same dose, in the absence of drug-related toxicity.





Serum Phosphate Level-Altering Agents



Clinical Impact


Co-administration of BALVERSA with other serum phosphate level-altering agents may increase or decrease serum phosphate levels
      
       [see
       
        Pharmacodynamics (12.2)].
      
       

Changes in serum phosphate levels due to serum phosphate level-altering agents (other than erdafitinib) may interfere with serum phosphate levels needed for the determination of initial dose increased based on serum phosphate levels
      
       [see
       
        Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
      
       





Clinical Management


Avoid co-administration of serum phosphate level-altering agents with BALVERSA before initial dose increase period based on serum phosphate levels (Days 14 to 21)
      
       [see
       
        Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
      
       














7.2 Effect of BALVERSA on Other Drugs

Table 8 summarizes the effect of BALVERSA on other drugs and their clinical management.

       [see
       
        Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
      
       

Increased plasma concentrations of P-gp substrates may lead to increased toxicity of the P-gp substrates.

7.2 Amphetamine & Other Drugs Affected by Urine Acidification


7.2
Amphetamine & Other Drugs Affected by Urine Acidification

Ascorbic acid may acidify the urine and lower serum concentrations of amphetamine by increasing renal excretion (as reflected by changes in amphetamine urine recovery rates). In case of decreased amphetamine efficacy discontinue ASCOR administration. Standard monitoring of therapy is warranted.
In addition, acidification of urine by ascorbic acid will alter the excretion of certain drugs affected by the pH of the urine (e.g., fluphenazine) when administered concurrently. It has been reported that concurrent administration of ascorbic acid and fluphenazine has resulted in decreased fluphenazine plasma concentrations. Standard monitoring of therapy is warranted.

In addition, acidification of urine by ascorbic acid will alter the excretion of certain drugs affected by the pH of the urine (e.g., fluphenazine) when administered concurrently. It has been reported that concurrent administration of ascorbic acid and fluphenazine has resulted in decreased fluphenazine plasma concentrations. Standard monitoring of therapy is warranted.

7.4 Laboratory Test Interference

Because ascorbic acid is a strong reducing agent, it can interfere with numerous laboratory tests based on oxidation-reduction reactions (e.g., glucose, nitrite and bilirubin levels, leukocyte count, etc.). Chemical detecting methods based on colorimetric reactions are generally those tests affected. Ascorbic acid may lead to inaccurate results (false negatives) obtained for checking blood or urinary glucose levels, nitrite, bilirubin, and leukocytes if tested during or within 24 hours after infusion

7.1 Cytochrome P450-Metabolized Drugs


Co-administration of tesamorelin with simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate had no significant impact on the pharmacokinetics profiles of simvastatin in healthy subjects [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
EGRIFTA SV stimulates GH production. Published data indicate that GH may modulate cytochrome P450 (CYP450) mediated antipyrine clearance. These data suggest that GH may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, and cyclosporine). Monitor patients for potential interactions when administering EGRIFTA SV in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes.








7.2 Glucocorticoids

GH inhibits 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11βHSD-1), a microsomal enzyme required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. EGRIFTA SV stimulates GH production; therefore, patients receiving glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in maintenance or stress doses following initiation of EGRIFTA SV. Patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone may be affected more than others because conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11βHSD-1.","simvastatin, corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine, cortisone acetate, prednisone"

Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.



 Anticoagulants: Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol (name previously used: bishydroxycoumarin) and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, acenocoumarol, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.


 Corticosteroids: Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.


 Griseofulvin: Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.


 Doxycycline: Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued.This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If phenobarbital and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.


 Phenytoin, sodium valproate, valproic acid: The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, while others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid appear to decrease barbiturate metabolism; therefore, barbiturate blood levels should be monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as indicated.


 Central nervous system depressants: The concomitant use of other central nervous system depressants, including other sedatives or hypnotics, antihistamines, tranquilizers, or alcohol, may produce additive depressant effects.


 Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI): MAOI prolong the effects of barbiturates probably because metabolism of the barbiturate is inhibited.


 Estradiol, estrone, progesterone and other steroidal hormones: Pretreatment with or concurrent administration of phenobarbital may decrease the effect of estradiol by increasing its metabolism. There have been reports of patients treated with antiepileptic drugs (e.g., phenobarbital) who became pregnant while taking oral contraceptives. An alternate contraceptive method might be suggested to women taking phenobarbital.","dicumarol, bishydroxycoumarin, warfarin, acenocoumarol, phenprocoumon, griseofulvin, doxycycline, phenytoin, sodium valproate, valproic acid, antihistamines, tranquilizers, alcohol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, estradiol, estrone, progesterone"

Use caution when co-prescribing aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs that may worsen gastrointestinal irritation. (7.2) 








7.1 Calcium Supplements/Antacids

Products containing calcium and other multivalent cations (such as aluminum, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with absorption of ibandronate sodium. Therefore, instruct patients to take ibandronate sodium at least 60 minutes before any oral medications, including medications containing multivalent cations (such as antacids, supplements or vitamins).

7.1 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

Because torsemide and salicylates compete for secretion by renal tubules, patients receiving high doses of salicylates may experience salicylate toxicity when torsemide is concomitantly administered.
Concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and torsemide has been associated with the development of acute renal failure. The antihypertensive and diuretic effects of torsemide can be reduced by NSAIDs.
Partial inhibition of the natriuretic effect of torsemide by concomitant administration of indomethacin has been demonstrated for torsemide under conditions of dietary sodium restriction (50 mEq/day) but not in the presence of normal sodium intake (150 mEq/day).








7.2 Cytochrome P450 2C9 Inhibitors and Inducers

Torsemide is a substrate of CYP2C9. Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inhibitors (e.g., amiodarone, fluconazole, miconazole, oxandrolone) can decrease torsemide clearance and increase torsemide plasma concentrations. Concomitant use of CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) increase torsemide clearance and decrease plasma torsemide concentrations. Monitor diuretic effect and blood pressure when used in combination with CYP2C9 inhibitor or inducer. Adjust torsemide dose if necessary.
Because of its inhibition of CYP2C9 metabolism, torsemide may affect the efficacy and safety of sensitive CYP2C9 substrates, such as celecoxib, or of substrates with a narrow therapeutic range, such as warfarin or phenytoin. Monitor patients and adjust dosages if necessary.








7.3 Cholestyramine

Concomitant use of torsemide and cholestyramine has not been studied in humans but, in a study in animals, coadministration of cholestyramine decreased the absorption of orally administered torsemide. If torsemide and cholestyramine should be coadministered, administer torsemide at least one hour before or 4 to 6 h after cholestyramine administration.








7.4 Organic Anion Drugs

Coadministration of organic anion drugs (e.g., probenecid) that undergo significant renal tubular secretion have the potential to reduce secretion of torsemide into the proximal tubule and thereby decreases the diuretic activity of torsemide. Monitor diuretic effect and blood pressure during coadministration.








7.5 Lithium

Like other diuretics, torsemide reduces the renal clearance of lithium, inducing a high risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when torsemide is coadministered.








7.6 Ototoxic Drugs

Loop diuretics increase the ototoxic potential of other ototoxic drugs, including aminoglycoside antibiotics and ethacrynic acid. This effect has been reported with concomitant use of torsemide and gentamycin. Avoid concomitant use of torsemide and aminoglycoside antibiotics, if possible.








7.7 Renin-angiotensin Inhibitors

Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants 

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines and other CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines, and other sedative hypnotics, anxiolytics, and tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics and other opioids, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.
Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS].


Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue), has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see PRECAUTIONS
,
Information for Patients/Caregivers].
If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue levorphanol tartrate tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Opioid Analgesics

The concomitant use of opioid with other opioid analgesics, such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, may reduce the analgesic effect of levorphanol tartrate tablets and precipitate withdrawal symptoms.
Advise patient to avoid concomitant use of these drugs.

Muscle Relaxants

Levorphanol may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.
Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of levorphanol tartrate tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see WARNINGS].

Diuretics

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. 
If concomitant use is warranted, evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.

7.1	Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism  

Concomitant administration of imatinib mesylate tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers may reduce total exposure of imatinib; consider alternative agents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 








7.2	Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism  

Concomitant administration of imatinib mesylate tablets and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may result in a significant imatinib exposure increase. Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of imatinib; avoid grapefruit juice [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 








7.3	Interactions With Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4  

Imatinib mesylate tablets will increase plasma concentration of CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.). Use caution when administering imatinib mesylate tablets with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.
Because warfarin is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, use low-molecular weight or standard heparin instead of warfarin in patients who require anticoagulation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 








7.4	Interactions With Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6  

Use caution when administering imatinib mesylate tablets with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window.Drug Interactions










Agents Inducing CYP3A Metabolism 

Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with multiple doses of rifampin followed by a single dose of imatinib mesylate tablets, increased imatinib mesylate tablets oral-dose clearance by 3.8-fold, which significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased mean Cmax and AUC. 
Similar findings were observed in patients receiving 400 to 1200 mg/day imatinib mesylate tablets concomitantly with enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drugs (EIAED) (e.g., carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, and primidone). The mean dose normalized AUC for imatinib in the patients receiving EIAED’s decreased by 73% compared to patients not receiving EIAED. 
Concomitant administration of imatinib mesylate tablets and St. John’s Wort led to a 30% reduction in the AUC of imatinib. 
Consider alternative therapeutic agents with less enzyme induction potential in patients when rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers are indicated. Imatinib mesylate tablets doses up to 1,200 mg/day (600 mg twice daily) have been given to patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers [see Dosage and Administration (2.12)]. 








Agents Inhibiting CYP3A Metabolism 

There was a significant increase in exposure to imatinib (mean Cmax and AUC increased by 26% and 40%, respectively) in healthy subjects when imatinib mesylate tablets were coadministered with a single dose of ketoconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution is recommended when administering imatinib mesylate tablets with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Grapefruit juice may also increase plasma concentrations of imatinib and should be avoided. 








Interactions with Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4 

Imatinib mesylate tablets increase the mean Cmax and AUC of simvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) 2- and 3.5-fold, respectively, suggesting an inhibition of the CYP3A4 by imatinib mesylate tablets. Particular caution is recommended when administering imatinib mesylate tablets with CYP3A4 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., alfentanil, cyclosporine, diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, or tacrolimus). 
Imatinib mesylate tablets will increase plasma concentration of other CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (e.g., triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, etc.). 
Because warfarin is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, patients who require anticoagulation should receive low-molecular weight or standard heparin instead of warfarin. 








Interactions with Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 

Imatinib mesylate tablets increased the mean Cmax and AUC of metoprolol by approximately 23% suggesting that imatinib mesylate tablets have a weak inhibitory effect on CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. No dose adjustment is necessary, however, caution is recommended when administering imatinib mesylate tablets with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic window. 








Interactions with Acetaminophen 


In vitro, imatinib mesylate tablets inhibit the acetaminophen O-glucuronidate pathway (Ki 58.5 μM). Coadministration of imatinib mesylate tablets (400 mg/day for 8 days) with acetaminophen (1,000 mg single dose on Day 8) in patients with CML did not result in any changes in the pharmacokinetics of acetaminophen. Imatinib mesylate tablets pharmacokinetics were not altered in the presence of single-dose acetaminophen. There is no pharmacokinetic or safety data on the concomitant use of imatinib mesylate tablets at doses greater than 400 mg/day or the chronic use of concomitant acetaminophen and imatinib mesylate tablets.","rifampin, carbamazepine, oxcarbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, St. John’s Wort, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, voriconazole, grapefruit juice, simvastatin, alfentanil, cyclosporine, diergotamine, ergotamine, fentanyl, pimozide, quinidine, sirolimus, tacrolimus, metoprolol, acetaminophen, triazolo-benzodiazepines, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, certain HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, warfarin"

Decreased phenytoin plasma levels: dosage adjustment may be  needed (7.1)







7.1       Antiepileptic Drugs


Phenytoin


Although phenytoin dose adjustments are not routinely required, dose adjustment of phenytoin should be considered if clinically indicated, since SABRIL may cause a moderate reduction in total phenytoin plasma levels [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Clonazepam


SABRIL may moderately increase the Cmax of clonazepam resulting in an increase of clonazepam-associated adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].


Other AEDs


There are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions between SABRIL and either phenobarbital or sodium valproate. Based on population pharmacokinetics, carbamazepine, clorazepate, primidone, and sodium valproate appear to have no effect on plasma concentrations of vigabatrin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.2       Oral Contraceptives

SABRIL is unlikely to affect the efficacy of steroid oral contraceptives [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)

Strong or Moderate CYP2C19 Inhibitors: Dosage adjustment of ONFI may be necessary (7.4)








7.1 Opioids

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids
increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different
receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at
GABAA sites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When
benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to
significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage
and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow
patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].








7.2 CNS Depressants and Alcohol

Concomitant use of ONFI with other CNS depressants may increase the risk of sedation and somnolence [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
Alcohol, as a CNS depressant, will interact with ONFI in a similar way and also increases clobazam's maximum plasma exposure by approximately 50%. Therefore, caution patients or their caregivers against simultaneous use with other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol, and caution that the effects of other CNS depressant drugs or alcohol may be potentiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].








7.3 Effect of ONFI on Other Drugs


Hormonal Contraceptives




ONFI is a weak CYP3A4 inducer. As some hormonal contraceptives are metabolized by CYP3A4, their effectiveness may be diminished when given with ONFI. Additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended when using ONFI [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6




ONFI inhibits CYP2D6. Dose adjustment of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 may be necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.4 Effect of Other Drugs on ONFI


Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19




Strong and moderate inhibitors of CYP2C19 may result in increased exposure to N-desmethylclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam. This may increase the risk of dose-related adverse reactions. Dosage adjustment of ONFI may be necessary when co-administered with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine) or moderate CYP2C19 inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","Alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, CNS depressants, hormonal contraceptives, fluconazole, fluvoxamine, ticlopidine, omeprazole"

7.1 Metabolic Interactions


In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4, such as St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) preparations, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin, may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice, may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.","medroxyprogesterone acetate, St. John's Wort, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rifampin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, grapefruit juice"

In clinical studies performed with fondaparinux sodium, the concomitant use of oral anticoagulants (warfarin), platelet inhibitors (acetylsalicylic acid), NSAIDs (piroxicam), and digoxin did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of fondaparinux sodium. In addition, fondaparinux sodium neither influenced the pharmacodynamics of warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, piroxicam, and digoxin, nor the pharmacokinetics of digoxin at steady state.
 Agents that may enhance the risk of hemorrhage should be discontinued prior to initiation of therapy with fondaparinux sodium unless these agents are essential. If co-administration is necessary, monitor patients closely for hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 In an in vitro study in human liver microsomes, inhibition of CYP2A6 hydroxylation of coumarin by fondaparinux (200 micromolar i.e., 350 mg/L) was 17 to 28%. Inhibition of the other isozymes evaluated (CYPs 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 3A4, and 3E1) was 0 to 16%. Since fondaparinux does not markedly inhibit CYP450s (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP3A4) in vitro, fondaparinux sodium is not expected to significantly interact with other drugs in vivo by inhibition of metabolism mediated by these isozymes.
 Since fondaparinux sodium does not bind significantly to plasma proteins other than ATIII, no drug interactions by protein-binding displacement are expected.

Ketoprofen does not alter aspirin absorption; however, in a study of 12 normal subjects, concurrent administration of aspirin decreased ketoprofen protein binding and increased ketoprofen plasma clearance from 0.07 L/kg/h without aspirin to 0.11 L/kg/h with aspirin. The clinical significance of these changes is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketoprofen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.








Diuretics

NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. Hydrochlorothiazide, given concomitantly with ketoprofen, produces a reduction in urinary potassium and chloride excretion compared to hydrochlorothiazide alone. Patients taking diuretics are at a greater risk of developing renal failure secondary to a decrease in renal blood flow caused by prostaglandin inhibition (see 
PRECAUTIONS
). During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
WARNINGS, Renal Effects
), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.








Digoxin

In a study in 12 patients with congestive heart failure where ketoprofen and digoxin were concomitantly administered, ketoprofen did not alter the serum levels of digoxin.








Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.








Methotrexate

Ketoprofen, like other NSAIDs, may cause changes in the elimination of methotrexate leading to elevated serum levels of the drug and increased toxicity. NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.








Probenecid

Probenecid increases both free and bound ketoprofen by reducing the plasma clearance of ketoprofen to about one-third, as well as decreasing its protein binding. Therefore, the combination of ketoprofen and probenecid is not recommended.








Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone. In a short-term controlled study in 14 normal volunteers, ketoprofen did not significantly interfere with the effect of warfarin on prothrombin time. Bleeding from a number of sites may be a complication of warfarin treatment and GI bleeding a complication of ketoprofen treatment. Because prostaglandins play an important role in hemostasis and ketoprofen has an effect on platelet function as well (see 
Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions, Effect on Blood Coagulation
), concurrent therapy with ketoprofen and warfarin requires close monitoring of patients on both drugs.","ACE-inhibitors, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide, aspirin, furosemide, thiazides, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, probenecid, warfarin"

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs, in general, on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than the users of either drug alone.








Aspirin

When ketorolac tromethamine is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free ketorolac tromethamine is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.








Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that ketorolac tromethamine can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
           
 
  
WARNINGS
,

Probenecid

Concomitant administration of ketorolac tromethamine tablets and 
           
 
  
probenecid
 resulted in decreased clearance and volume of distribution of ketorolac and significant increases in ketorolac plasma levels (total AUC increased approximately threefold from 5.4 to 17.8 mcg/h/mL) and terminal half-life increased approximately twofold from 6.6 to 15.1 hours. Therefore, concomitant use of ketorolac tromethamine and probenecid is contraindicated.
          

 








Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.








Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.








ACE Inhibitors/Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists

Concomitant use of 
           
 
  
ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists
 may increase the risk of renal impairment, particularly in volume-depleted patients.
          

 
Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor antagonists.








Antiepileptic Drugs

	DRUG INTERACTIONS


Milnacipran undergoes minimal CYP450 related metabolism, with the majority of the dose excreted unchanged in urine (55%) and has a low binding to plasma proteins (13%). In vitro and in vivo studies showed that SAVELLA is unlikely to be involved in clinically significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions [see Pharmacokinetics in Special Populations (

12.3

)].






SAVELLA is unlikely to be involved in clinically significant  pharmacokinetic drug interactions (7). 

Pharmacodynamic interactions of SAVELLA with other drugs can occur (7).









7.1
		     
	Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors
 (MAOIs)


The concomitant use of SSRIs and SNRIs, including SAVELLA, with MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. The use of MAOIs intended to treat psychiatric disorders with SAVELLA or within 5 days of stopping treatment with SAVELLA is contraindicated. The use of SAVELLA within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders is also contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate SAVELLA in a patient who is being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with a MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking SAVELLA, discontinue SAVELLA before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Dosage and Administration (

	Serotonergic Drugs


Serotonin syndrome can occur with use of SAVELLA and other serotonergic drugs (other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John’s Wort), or with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (i.e., monoamine oxidase inhibitors).

There have been rare postmarketing reports of serotonin syndrome with use of an SSRI and a triptan.  If concomitant treatment of SAVELLA with a triptan is clinically warranted, careful observation of the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.2

)].









7.4
		     
	Catecholamines


SAVELLA inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. Therefore, concomitant use of SAVELLA with epinephrine and norepinephrine may be associated with paroxysmal hypertension and possible arrhythmia [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.3

, 

5.4

)].









7.5
		     
	CNS-active drugs 


Given the primary CNS effects of SAVELLA, use caution when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs, including those with a similar mechanism of action.

Clomipramine: In a drug-drug interaction study, an increase in euphoria and postural hypotension was observed in patients who switched from clomipramine to SAVELLA.









7.6
		     
	Clinically Important Interactions with Select Cardiovascular Agents


Digoxin: Use of SAVELLA concomitantly with digoxin may be associated with potentiation of adverse hemodynamic effects. Postural hypotension and tachycardia have been reported in combination therapy with intravenously administered digoxin (1 mg). Avoid co-administration of SAVELLA and intravenous digoxin [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.3

,

Clonidine: Because SAVELLA inhibits norepinephrine reuptake, co-administration with clonidine may inhibit clonidine’s anti-hypertensive effect.









7.7
		     
	Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis


Concomitant use of SAVELLA with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug (e.g., NSAIDs, aspirin, and warfarin) may potentiate the risk of bleeding. This may be due to the effect of SAVELLA on the release of serotonin by platelets. Closely monitor for bleeding for patients receiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug when SAVELLA is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (

7.1 Vitamin A

Isotretinoin is closely related to vitamin A. Therefore, the use of both vitamin A and isotretinoin at the same time may lead to vitamin A related adverse reactions. Patients treated with isotretinoin should be advised against taking supplements containing Vitamin A to avoid additive toxic effects. 








7.2 Tetracyclines

Concomitant treatment with isotretinoin and tetracyclines should be avoided because isotretinoin use has been associated with a number of cases of intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), some of which involved concomitant use of tetracyclines [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 









7.3 Phenytoin

Phenytoin is known to cause osteomalacia. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss between phenytoin and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.








7.4 Systemic Corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are known to cause osteoporosis. No formal clinical trials have been conducted to assess if there is an interactive effect on bone loss with concomitant use of systemic corticosteroids and isotretinoin. Therefore, caution should be exercised when using these drugs together.

In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions


In in vitro studies, dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide neither inhibited CYP 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4, nor induced CYP 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Dapagliflozin is a weak substrate of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) active transporter, and dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is a substrate for the OAT3 active transporter. Dapagliflozin or dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide did not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 active transporters. Overall, dapagliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 substrates.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies performed with racemic cetirizine demonstrated that cetirizine did not interact with antipyrine, pseudoephedrine, erythromycin, azithromycin, ketoconazole, and cimetidine. There was a small decrease (~16%) in the clearance of cetirizine caused by a 400 mg dose of theophylline. It is possible that higher theophylline doses could have a greater effect.

Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids


The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

Other CNS Depressants

The sedative effect of intravenous midazolam is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly opioids (e.g., morphine, meperidine and fentanyl) and also secobarbital and droperidol. Consequently, the dosage of midazolam should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).

Other Drug Interactions

Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the P450-3A4 enzyme system such as cimetidine (not ranitidine), erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole and itraconazole. These drug interactions may result in prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam.
The effect of single oral doses of 800 mg cimetidine and 300 mg ranitidine on steady-state concentrations of oral midazolam was examined in a randomized crossover study (n=8). Cimetidine increased the mean midazolam steady-state concentration from 57 to 71 ng/mL. Ranitidine increased the mean steady-state concentration to 62 ng/mL. No change in choice reaction time or sedation index was detected after dosing with the H2 receptor antagonists.
In a placebo-controlled study, erythromycin administered as a 500 mg dose, three times a day, for 1 week (n=6), reduced the clearance of midazolam following a single 0.5 mg/kg IV dose. The half-life was approximately doubled.
Caution is advised when midazolam is administered to patients receiving erythromycin since this may result in a decrease in the plasma clearance of midazolam.
The effects of diltiazem (60 mg three times a day) and verapamil (80 mg three times a day) on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral midazolam were investigated in a three-way crossover study (n=9).
The half-life of midazolam increased from 5 to 7 hours when midazolam was taken in conjunction with verapamil or diltiazem. No interaction was observed in healthy subjects between midazolam and nifedipine.
In a placebo-controlled study where saquinavir or placebo was administered orally as a 1200 mg dose, three times a day, for 5 days (n=12), a 56% reduction in the clearance of midazolam following a single 0.05 mg/kg IV dose was observed. The half-life was approximately doubled.
A moderate reduction in induction dosage requirements of thiopental (about 15%) has been noted following use of intramuscular midazolam hydrochloride for premedication in adults.
The intravenous administration of midazolam hydrochloride decreases the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of halothane required for general anesthesia. This decrease correlates with the dose of midazolam hydrochloride administered; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults.
Although the possibility of minor interactive effects has not been fully studied, midazolam and pancuronium have been used together in patients without noting clinically significant changes in dosage, onset or duration in adults. Midazolam hydrochloride does not protect against the characteristic circulatory changes noted after administration of succinylcholine or pancuronium and does not protect against the increased intracranial pressure noted following administration of succinylcholine. Midazolam does not cause a clinically significant change in dosage, onset or duration of a single intubating dose of succinylcholine; no similar studies have been carried out in pediatric patients but there is no scientific reason to expect that pediatric patients would respond differently than adults.
No significant adverse interactions with commonly used premedications or drugs used during anesthesia and surgery (including atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, d-tubocurarine, succinylcholine and other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants) or topical local anesthetics (including lidocaine, dyclonine HCl and Cetacaine) have been observed in adults or pediatric patients. In neonates, however, severe hypotension has been reported with concomitant administration of fentanyl. This effect has been observed in neonates on an infusion of midazolam who received a rapid injection of fentanyl and in patients on an infusion of fentanyl who have received a rapid injection of midazolam.","benzodiazepines, opioids, morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, secobarbital, droperidol, cimetidine, erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ranitidine, saquinavir, thiopental, halothane, pancuronium, succinylcholine, atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, d-tubocurarine, lidocaine, dyclonine HCl, Cetacaine"

  which can increase the risk of salicylate toxicity. Anorexia, tachypnea, lethargy, and coma have been reported with concomitant use of dichlorphenamide and high-dose aspirin. Therefore, concomitant use of KEVEYIS and high-dose aspirin is contraindicated. Patients with concomitant use of KEVEYIS and low-dose aspirin should be carefully monitored 
         
 
  [see

   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
         
 
  









7.2 Drugs that are Substrates of Organic Anion Transporter1 (OAT1)


In vitro, dichlorphenamide is an inhibitor of OAT1 transporters. The concomitant administration of KEVEYIS may increase the plasma exposures of OAT1 substrates. Use of KEVEYIS with  drugs that are sensitive to OAT1 inhibition (e.g., methotrexate, famotidine, oseltamivir) is not recommended 
         
 
  [see

Promptly evaluate any signs or symptoms of blood loss if patients are treated concomitantly with anticoagulants, aspirin, other platelet aggregation inhibitors, and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
Long-term concomitant treatment with SAVAYSA and other anticoagulants is not recommended because of increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Short term co-administration may be needed for patients transitioning to or from SAVAYSA [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 
In clinical studies with SAVAYSA concomitant use of aspirin (low dose ≤ 100 mg/day) or thienopyridines, and NSAIDs was permitted and resulted in increased rates of Clinically Relevant Bleeding. Carefully monitor for bleeding in patients who require chronic treatment with low dose aspirin and/or NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

SIROLIMUS oral solutionInitial U.S. Approval: 1999",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and p-glycoprotein (P-gp). Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-gp may decrease sirolimus concentrations whereas inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase sirolimus concentrations.







Avoid concomitant use with strong CYP3A4/P-gp inducers or strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitors that decrease or increase sirolimus concentrations (7.4, 12.3).
See full prescribing information for complete list of clinically significant drug interactions (12.3).









7.1 Use with Cyclosporine

Cyclosporine, a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P-gp, was demonstrated to increase sirolimus concentrations when co-administered with sirolimus. In order to diminish the effect of this interaction with cyclosporine, it is recommended that sirolimus be taken 4 hours after administration of cyclosporine oral solution (MODIFIED) and/or cyclosporine capsules (MODIFIED). If cyclosporine is withdrawn from combination therapy with sirolimus, higher doses of sirolimus are needed to maintain the recommended sirolimus trough concentration ranges [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.2 Strong Inducers and Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp

Avoid concomitant use of sirolimus with strong inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) and strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, voriconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, telithromycin, clarithromycin) of CYP3A4 and P-gp. Alternative agents with lesser interaction potential with sirolimus should be considered [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.3 Grapefruit Juice

Because grapefruit juice inhibits the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of sirolimus, it must not be taken with or be used for dilution of sirolimus [see Dosage and Administration (2.9), Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.4 Weak and Moderate Inducers or Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp

Exercise caution when using sirolimus with drugs or agents that are modulators of CYP3A4 and P-gp. The dosage of sirolimus and/or the co-administered drug may need to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Drugs that could increase sirolimus blood concentrations:Bromocriptione, cimetidine, cisapride, clotrimazole, danazol, diltiazem, fluconazole, protease inhibitors (e.g., HIV and hepatitis C that include drugs such as ritonavir, indinavir, boceprevir, and telaprevir), metoclopramide, nicardipine, troleandomycin, verapamil

7.1 Incompatibilities

Furosemide, benzodiazepines and phenytoin have been found to be incompatible with hyaluronidase.








7.2 Drug-Specific Precautions

Hyaluronidase should not be used to enhance the absorption and dispersion of dopamine and/or alpha agonist drugs.
When considering the administration of any other drug with hyaluronidase, it is recommended that appropriate references first be consulted to determine the usual precautions for the use of the other drug.








7.3 Local Anesthetic Agent

When hyaluronidase is added to a local anesthetic agent, it hastens the onset of analgesia and tends to reduce the swelling caused by local infiltration, but the wider spread of the local anesthetic solution increases its absorption; this shortens its duration of action and tends to increase the incidences of systemic reaction.








7.4 Salicylates, Cortisone, ACTH, Estrogens, Antihistamines

Patients receiving large doses of salicylates, cortisone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), estrogens, or antihistamines may require larger amounts of hyaluronidase for equivalent dispersing effect, since these drugs apparently render tissues partly resistant to the action of hyaluronidase.","Furosemide,benzodiazepines,phenytoin,dopamine,alpha agonist drugs,salicylates,cortisone,adrenocorticotropic hormone,estrogens,antihistamines"

ACE-inhibitors

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.








Aspirin

Salicylates antagonize the uricosuric action of drugs used to treat gout. ASPIRIN AND OTHER SALICYLATE DRUGS WILL BE ADDITIVE TO SALSALATE AND MAY INCREASE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF SALICYLIC ACID TO TOXIC LEVELS. Drugs and foods that raise urine pH will increase renal clearance and urinary excretion of salicylic acid, thus lowering plasma levels: acidifying drugs or foods will decrease urinary excretion and increase plasma levels. Salicylates given concomitantly with anticoagulant drugs may predispose to systemic bleeding. Salicylates may enhance the hypoglycemic effect of oral antidiabetic drugs of the sulfonylurea class. Salicylate competes with a number of drugs for protein binding sites, notably penicillin, thiopental, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, phenytoin, sulfinpyrazone, naproxen, warfarin, methotrexate, and possibly corticosteroids.
[When Salsalate tablets, USP are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free Salsalate tablets, USP are not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however,] as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of salsalate and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.








Furosemide

Clinical studies, as well as post marketing observations, have shown that Salsalate tablets, USP can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
PRECAUTIONS, Renal Effects
), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.








Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.








Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.








Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.","ACE-inhibitors,Aspirin,penicillin,thiopental,thyroxine,triiodothyronine,phenytoin,sulfinpyrazone,naproxen,warfarin,methotrexate,corticosteroids,Furosemide,thiazides,Lithium"

Beta-adrenergic blocking agents: Patients who are receiving a beta-adrenergic blocking agent orally and timolol should be observed for potential additive effects of beta-blockade, both systemic and on intraocular pressure. The concomitant use of two topical beta-adrenergic blocking agents is not recommended.

Calcium antagonists: Caution should be used in the coadministration of beta-adrenergic blocking agents, such as timolol, and oral or intravenous calcium antagonists because of possible atrioventricular conduction disturbances, left ventricular failure, and hypotension. In patients with impaired cardiac function, coadministration should be avoided.

Catecholamine-depleting drugs: Close observation of the patient is recommended when a beta blocker is administered to patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs such as reserpine, because of possible additive effects and the production of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia, which may result in vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.

Digitalis and calcium antagonists: The concomitant use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents with digitalis and calcium antagonists may have additive effects in prolonging atrioventricular conduction time.

CYP2D6 inhibitors: Potentiated systemic beta-blockade (e.g., decreased heart rate, depression) has been reported during combined treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g. quinidine, SSRIs) and timolol.

When administered concurrently, the following drugs may interact with adrenal corticosteroids.

Amphotericin B or potassium-depleting diuretics (benzothiadiazines and related drugs, ethacrynic acid and furosemide)—enhanced hypokalemia. Check serum potassium levels at frequent intervals; use potassium supplements if necessary (see 
WARNINGS
).

Digitalis glycosides— enhanced possibility of arrhythmias or digitalis toxicity associated with hypokalemia. Monitor serum potassium levels; use potassium supplements if necessary.

Oral anticoagulants— decreased prothrombin time response. Monitor prothrombin levels and adjust anticoagulant dosage accordingly.

Antidiabetic drugs (oral agents and insulin)—diminished antidiabetic effect. Monitor for symptoms of hyperglycemia; adjust dosage of antidiabetic drug upward if necessary.

Aspirin— increased ulcerogenic effect; decreased pharmacologic effect of aspirin. Rarely salicylate toxicity may occur in patients who discontinue steroids after concurrent high-dose aspirin therapy. Monitor salicylate levels or the therapeutic effect for which aspirin is given; adjust salicylate dosage accordingly if effect is altered (see 
PRECAUTIONS, General
).

Barbiturates, phenytoin, or rifampin—increased metabolic clearance of fludrocortisone acetate because of the induction of hepatic enzymes. Observe the patient for possible diminished effect of steroid and increase the steroid dosage accordingly.

Anabolic steroids (particularly C-17 alkylated androgens such as oxymetholone, methandrostenolone, norethandrolone, and similar compounds)—enhanced tendency toward edema. Use caution when giving these drugs together, especially in patients with hepatic or cardiac disease.

Vaccines—neurological complications and lack of antibody response (see 
WARNINGS
).

Estrogen—increased levels of corticosteroid-binding globulin thereby increasing the bound (inactive) fraction; this effect is at least balanced by decreased metabolism of corticosteroids. When estrogen therapy is initiated, a reduction in corticosteroid dosage may be required, and increased amounts may be required when estrogen is terminated.","Amphotericin B, benzothiadiazines, ethacrynic acid, furosemide, Digitalis glycosides, Oral anticoagulants, Antidiabetic drugs, insulin, Aspirin, Barbiturates, phenytoin, rifampin, Anabolic steroids, oxymetholone, methandrostenolone, norethandrolone, Vaccines, Estrogen"

ACE-inhibitors and Angiotensin II Anagonists

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors and angiotensin II antagonists. These interactions should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists. In some patients with compromised renal function, the co-administration of an NSAID and an ACE-inhibitor or an angiotensin II antagonist may result in further deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure, which is usually reversible.







Acetaminophen

In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen resulted in an approximate 50% increase in plasma levels of acetaminophen. Acetaminophen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal. Since acetaminophen in high doses has been associated with hepatotoxicity, concomitant administration of diflunisal tablets and acetaminophen should be used cautiously, with careful monitoring of patients.
Concomitant administration of diflunisal and acetaminophen in dogs, but not in rats, at approximately 2 times the recommended maximum human therapeutic dose of each (40 to 52 mg/kg/day of diflunisal/acetaminophen), resulted in greater gastrointestinal toxicity than when either drug was administered alone. The clinical significance of these findings has not been established.







Antacids

Concomitant administration of antacids may reduce plasma levels of diflunisal. This effect is small with occasional doses of antacids, but may be clinically significant when antacids are used on a continuous schedule.







Aspirin

When diflunisal is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free diflunisal is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of diflunisal tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.
In normal volunteers, a small decrease in diflunisal levels was observed when multiple doses of diflunisal and aspirin were administered concomitantly.







Cyclosporine

Administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs concomitantly with cyclosporine has been associated with an increase in cyclosporine-induced toxicity, possibly due to decreased synthesis of renal prostacyclin. NSAIDs should be used with caution in patients taking cyclosporine, and renal function should be carefully monitored.







Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that diflunisal can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.
In normal volunteers, concomitant administration of diflunisal and hydrochlorothiazide resulted in significantly increased plasma levels of hydrochlorothiazide. Diflunisal decreased the hyperuricemic effect of hydrochlorothiazide. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
WARNINGS, Renal Effects
), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.







Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.







Methotrexate

NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.







NSAIDs

The administration of diflunisal to normal volunteers receiving indomethacin decreased the renal clearance and significantly increased the plasma levels of indomethacin. In some patients the combined use of indomethacin and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Therefore, indomethacin and diflunisal tablets should not be used concomitantly.
The concomitant use of diflunisal tablets and other NSAIDs is not recommended due to the increased possibility of gastrointestinal toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy. The following information was obtained from studies in normal volunteers.







Sulindac

The concomitant administration of diflunisal and sulindac in normal volunteers resulted in lowering of the plasma levels of the active sulindac sulfide metabolite by approximately one-third.







Naproxen

The concomitant administration of diflunisal and naproxen in normal volunteers had no effect on the plasma levels of naproxen, but significantly decreased the urinary excretion of naproxen and its glucuronide metabolite. Naproxen had no effect on plasma levels of diflunisal.","ACE-inhibitors, Angiotensin II antagonists, Acetaminophen, Antacids, Aspirin, Cyclosporine, Furosemide, Thiazides, Hydrochlorothiazide, Lithium, Methotrexate, Indomethacin, Sulindac, Naproxen"

Table 2. Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with Lansoprazole Delayed Release Capsules and Interactions with Diagnostics





Antiretrovirals




Clinical Impact:

The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.
    
     
Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with lansoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.
Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with lansoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs.
There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with lansoprazole.





Intervention:
   
    

Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with Lansoprazole delayed release capsules is contraindicated [
    
     see Contraindications (
4
)]. See prescribing information.
    
     
Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir for dosing information.
    
     
Nelfinavir: Avoid concomitant use with Lansoprazole. See prescribing information for nelfinavir.
    
     
Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities.
    
     
Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information.
   
    



Warfarin




Clinical Impact:

Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.



Intervention:
   
    
Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin.



Methotrexate




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].
   
    



Intervention:
   
    
A temporary withdrawal of Lansoprazole may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.



Digoxin




Clinical Impact:

Potential for increased exposure of digoxin



Intervention:
   
    
Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin.



Theophylline




Clinical Impact :

Increased clearance of theophylline [
    
     see Clinical Pharmacology (
12.3
)].
   
    



Intervention

Individual patients may require additional titration of their theophylline dosage when Lansoprazole is started or stopped to ensure clinically effective blood concentrations.



Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole)




Clinical Impact:

Lansoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.



Intervention:
   
    
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving Lansoprazole and MMF. Use Lansoprazole with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF.
    
     See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.
   
    



Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions.



Intervention:
   
    


See Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin.
See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin.





Tacrolimus




Clinical Impact:

Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.



Intervention:
   
    
Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus.



Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors




ClinicalImpact:
   
    
CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [
    
     see Warnings and Precautions (5.9), Clinical Pharmacology (
12.2
)].




Intervention:
   
    
Temporarily stop Lansoprazole delayed release capsules treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.



Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test




Clinical Impact:

Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.



Intervention:
   
    
Temporarily stop Lansoprazole treatment at least 28 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline [
    
     see Clinical Pharmacology (
12.2
)].




False Positive Urine Tests for THC




Clinical Impact:

There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.



Intervention:
   
    
An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.

HYDROCHLORIDE injection, for intravenous use

Initial U.S. Approval: 1988",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS







Cimetidine increases nicardipine plasma levels (7.3).


Nicardipine may increase cyclosporine and tacrolimus plasma levels. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended when co-administering nicardipine. (7.5, 7.6).









7.1 Antihypertensive Agents

Since nicardipine hydrochloride injection may be administered to patients already being treated with other medications, including other antihypertensive agents, careful monitoring of these patients is necessary to detect and to treat promptly any undesired effects from concomitant administration. 








7.2 Beta-Blockers

In most patients, nicardipine hydrochloride injection can safely be used concomitantly with beta-blockers. However, monitor response carefully when combining nicardipine hydrochloride injection with a beta-blocker in the treatment of congestive heart failure patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].








7.3 Cimetidine

Cimetidine has been shown to increase nicardipine plasma concentrations with oral nicardipine administration. Carefully monitor patients receiving the two drugs concomitantly. Data with other histamine-2 antagonists are not available.








7.4 Digoxin

Studies have shown that oral nicardipine usually does not alter digoxin plasma concentrations. 








7.5 Cyclosporine

Concomitant administration of oral or intravenous nicardipine and cyclosporine results in elevated plasma cyclosporine levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Monitor closely plasma concentrations of cyclosporine during nicardipine hydrochloride injection administration, and adjust the dose of cyclosporine accordingly.








7.6 Tacrolimus

Concomitant administration of intravenous nicardipine and tacrolimus may result in elevated plasma tacrolimus levels through nicardipine inhibition of hepatic microsomal enzymes, including CYP3A4. Closely monitor plasma concentrations of tacrolimus during nicardipine administration, and adjust the dose of tacrolimus accordingly.

•Avoid use with strong CYP3A inhibitors or CYP3A inducers. (7.1, 7.2)


•Opioids: Decreased exposure to ticagrelor. Consider use of parenteral anti-platelet agent. (7.4)


•Patients receiving more than 40 mg per day of simvastatin or lovastatin may be at increased risk of statin-related adverse effects. (7.5)


•Monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or any change in BRILINTA. (7.6)









7.1 Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Strong CYP3A inhibitors substantially increase ticagrelor exposure and so increase the risk of dyspnea, bleeding, and other adverse events. Avoid use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir and telithromycin) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Strong CYP3A Inducers

Strong CYP3A inducers substantially reduce ticagrelor exposure and so decrease the efficacy of ticagrelor. Avoid use with strong inducers of CYP3A (e.g., rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 Aspirin

Use of BRILINTA with aspirin maintenance doses above 100 mg reduced the effectiveness of BRILINTA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Studies (14.1)].









7.4 Opioids

As with other oral P2Y12 inhibitors, co-administration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of ticagrelor and its active metabolite presumably because of slowed gastric emptying [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Consider the use of a parenteral anti-platelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring co-administration of morphine or other opioid agonists.








7.5 Simvastatin, Lovastatin 

BRILINTA increases serum concentrations of simvastatin and lovastatin because these drugs are metabolized by CYP3A4. Avoid simvastatin and lovastatin doses greater than 40 mg [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.6 Digoxin

BRILINTA inhibits the P-glycoprotein transporter; monitor digoxin levels with initiation of or change in BRILINTA therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, atazanavir, telithromycin, rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, aspirin, morphine, simvastatin, lovastatin, digoxin"

7.1 CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers


Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors 


The active metabolite of deflazacort, 21-desDFZ, is a substrate of CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of deflazacort with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased total exposure to 21-desDFZ by about 3-fold. Therefore, give one third the recommended dosage of deflazacort when moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., clarithromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil, grapefruit juice) are used concomitantly with deflazacort [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 


Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inducers 


Co-administration of deflazacort with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, significantly decreased the exposure of 21-desDFZ. Avoid concomitant use of strong (e.g., efavirenz) or moderate (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin) CYP3A4 inducers with deflazacort [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

MAO inhibitors- MAOI antidepressants, as well as a metabolic of furazolidone, slow amphetamine metabolism. This slowing potentiates amphetamines, increasing their effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings; this can cause headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. A variety of neurological toxic effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results.

Serotonergic Drugs- The concomitant use of amphetamine sulfate tablets and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during amphetamine sulfate tablets initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue amphetamine sulfate tablets and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) (see 
  WARNING and 
  PRECAUTIONS).
 

CYP2D6 Inhibitors- The concomitant use of amphetamine sulfate tablets and CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the exposure of amphetamine sulfate tablets compared to the use of the drug alone and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome particularly during amphetamine sulfate tablets initiation and after a dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue amphetamine sulfate tablets and the CYP2D6 inhibitor (see 
  WARNING, 
  OVERDOSAGE). Examples of CYP2D6 Inhibitors include paroxetine and fluoxetine (also serotonergic drugs), quinidine, ritonavir.
 


Acidifying agents

Gastrointestinal acidifying agents (guanethidine, reserpine, glutamic acid HCl, ascorbic acid, fruit juices, etc.) lower absorption of amphetamines. Urinary acidifying agents (ammonium chloride, sodium acid phosphate, etc.) increase concentration of the ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby increasing urinary excretion.
Both groups of agents lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.


Adrenergic blockers

Adrenergic blockers are inhibited by amphetamines.


Alkalinizing agents

Gastrointestinal alkalinizing agents (sodium bicarbonate, etc.) increase absorption of amphetamines. Urinary alkalinizing agents (acetazolamide, some thiazides) increase the concentration of the non-ionized species of the amphetamine molecule, thereby decreasing urinary excretion. Both groups of agents increase blood levels and therefore potentiate the action of amphetamines.


Antidepressants tricyclic

Amphetamines may enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents; d-amphetamine with desipramine or protriptyline and possibly other tricyclics cause striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d- amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated.


Antihistamines

Amphetamines may counteract the sedative effect of antihistamines.


Antihypertensives

Amphetamines may antagonize the hypotensive effects of antihypertensives.


Chlorpromazine

Chlorpromazine blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant effects of amphetamine, and can be used to treat amphetamine poisoning.


Ethosuximide

Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of ethosuximide.


Haloperidol

Haloperidol blocks dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake, thus inhibiting the central stimulant affects of amphetamines.


Lithium carbonate

The antiobesity and stimulatory effects of amphetamines may be inhibited by lithium carbonate.


Meperidine

Amphetamines potentiate the analgesic effect of meperidine.


Methenamine therapy

Urinary excretion of amphetamines is increased, and efficacy is reduced by acidifying agents used in methenamine therapy.


Norepinephrine

Amphetamines enhance the adrenergic effect of norepinephrine.


Phenobarbital

Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of Phenobarbital. Co-administration of phenobarbital may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.


Phenytoin

Amphetamines may delay intestinal absorption of phenytoin; co-administration of phenytoin may produce a synergistic anticonvulsant action.


Propoxyphene

In cases of propoxyphene overdosage, amphetamine CNS stimulation is potentiated and fatal convulsions can occur.


Veratrum alkaloids

Topical benzoyl peroxide used at the same time as dapsone may result in temporary local yellow or orange skin discoloration. (7.2).








7.1	Trimethoprim – Sulfamethoxazole

A drug-drug interaction study evaluated the effect of the use of dapsone gel, 5%, in combination with double strength (160 mg/800 mg) trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). During co-administration, systemic levels of TMP and SMX were essentially unchanged. However, levels of dapsone and its metabolites increased in the presence of TMP/SMX. Systemic exposure (AUC0-12) of dapsone and N-acetyl-dapsone (NAD) were increased by about 40% and 20% respectively in the presence of TMP/SMX. Notably, systemic exposure (AUC0-12) of dapsone hydroxylamine (DHA) was more than doubled in the presence of TMP/SMX. Exposure from the proposed topical dose is about 1 % of that from the 100 mg oral dose, even when co-administered with TMP/SMX.








7.2	Topical Benzoyl Peroxide

Topical application of dapsone gel followed by benzoyl peroxide in subjects with acne vulgaris resulted in a temporary local yellow or orange discoloration of the skin and facial hair (reported by 7 out of 95 subjects in a clinical study) with resolution in 4 to 57 days.








7.3	Drug Interactions with Oral Dapsone

Certain concomitant medications (such as rifampin, anticonvulsants, St. John's wort) may increase the formation of dapsone hydroxylamine, a metabolite of dapsone associated with hemolysis. With oral dapsone treatment, folic acid antagonists such as pyrimethamine have been noted to possibly increase the likelihood of hematologic reactions.








7.4	Concomitant Use with Drugs that Induce Methemoglobinemia

Concomitant use of dapsone with drugs that induce methemoglobinemia such as sulfonamides, acetaminophen, acetanilide, aniline dyes, benzocaine, chloroquine, dapsone, naphthalene, nitrates and nitrites, nitrofurantoin, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, pamaquine, para‐aminosalicylic acid, phenacetin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primaquine, and quinine may increase the risk for developing methemoglobinemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].","Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole, Benzoyl Peroxide, Rifampin, Anticonvulsants, St. John's Wort, Pyrimethamine, Sulfonamides, Acetaminophen, Acetanilide, Aniline Dyes, Benzocaine, Chloroquine, Naphthalene, Nitrates, Nitrites, Nitrofurantoin, Nitroglycerin, Nitroprusside, Pamaquine, Para‐aminosalicylic Acid, Phenacetin, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Primaquine, Quinine"

7.1 Reduction of Risk of Stroke and Systemic Embolism in Non-valvular Atrial Fibrillation in Adult Patients

The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules with P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampin) reduces exposure to dabigatran and should generally be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)].
P-gp inhibition and impaired renal function are the major independent factors that result in increased exposure to dabigatran [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors in patients with renal impairment is expected to produce increased exposure of dabigatran compared to that seen with either factor alone.
In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30 to 50 mL/min), reduce the dosage of dabigatran etexilate capsules to 75 mg twice daily when administered concomitantly with the P-gp inhibitors dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole. The use of the P-gp inhibitors verapamil, amiodarone, quinidine, clarithromycin, and ticagrelor does not require a dosage adjustment of dabigatran etexilate capsules. These results should not be extrapolated to other P-gp inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.5), Use in Specific Populations  (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)].
The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 30 mL/min) should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions  (5.5), Use in Specific Populations  (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology  (12.3)].

7.3 Prophylaxis of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism in Adult Patients Following Hip Replacement Surgery

In patients with CrCl ≥50 mL/min who have concomitant administration of P-gp inhibitors such as dronedarone or systemic ketoconazole, it may be helpful to separate the timing of administration of dabigatran and the P-gp inhibitor by several hours. The concomitant use of dabigatran etexilate capsules and P-gp inhibitors in patients with CrCl <50 mL/min should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific

Interacting Drug 



Interaction 




Multivalent cation-containing products including: antacids, sucralfate, multivitamins

Decreased moxifloxacin hydrochloride absorption. Take moxifloxacin tablet at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these products. (2.2, 7.1, 12.3) 



Warfarin 

Anticoagulant effect enhanced. Monitor prothrombin time/INR, and bleeding. (6, 7.2, 12.3) 



Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics: 

Proarrhythmic effect may be enhanced. Avoid concomitant use. (5.6, 7.5) 



Antidiabetic agents

Carefully monitor blood glucose. (5.12, 7.3)











7.1 Antacids, Sucralfate, Multivitamins and Other Products Containing Multivalent Cations


 Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, form chelates with alkaline earth and transition metal cations. Oral administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride with antacids containing aluminum or magnesium, with sucralfate, with metal cations such as iron, or with multivitamins containing iron or zinc, or with formulations containing divalent and trivalent cations such as didanosine buffered tablets for oral suspension or the pediatric powder for oral solution, may substantially interfere with the absorption of moxifloxacin hydrochloride, resulting in systemic concentrations considerably lower than desired. Therefore, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be taken at least 4 hours before or 8 hours after these agents [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)  and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.2 Warfarin

Fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, have been reported to enhance the anticoagulant effects of warfarin or its derivatives in the patient population. In addition, infectious disease and its accompanying inflammatory process, age, and general status of the patient are risk factors for increased anticoagulant activity. Therefore the prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if moxifloxacin hydrochloride is administered concomitantly with warfarin or its derivatives [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.3 Antidiabetic Agents

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered. If a hypoglycemic reaction occurs, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be discontinued and appropriate therapy should be initiated immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].









7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

The concomitant administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a fluoroquinolone, including moxifloxacin hydrochloride, may increase the risks of CNS stimulation and convulsions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].









7.5 Drugs that Prolong QT

There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction in humans between moxifloxacin hydrochloride and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. Sotalol, a Class III antiarrhythmic, has been shown to further increase the QTc interval when combined with high doses of intravenous moxifloxacin hydrochloride in dogs. Therefore, moxifloxacin hydrochloride should be avoided with Class IA and Class III antiarrhythmics [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].","antacids, sucralfate, multivitamins, warfarin, Class IA antiarrhythmics, Class III antiarrhythmics, antidiabetic agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sotalol, didanosine"

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists.
Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.
If estazolam is given concomitantly with other drugs acting on the central nervous system, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of all agents. The action of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, or other drugs that produce CNS depression. Smokers have an increased clearance of benzodiazepines as compared to nonsmokers; this was seen in studies with estazolam (see 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
).
While no in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were conducted between estazolam and inducers of CYP3A, compounds that are potent CYP3A inducers (such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, and barbiturates) would be expected to decrease estazolam concentrations.






Estazolam Interaction with Drugs That Inhibit Metabolism via Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A)

The metabolism of estazolam to the major circulating metabolite 4-hydroxy-estazolam and the metabolism of other triazolobenzodiazepines is catalyzed by CYP3A. Consequently, estazolam should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole and itraconazole, which are very potent inhibitors of CYP3A (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
). With drugs inhibiting CYP3A to a lesser, but still significant degree, estazolam should be used only with caution and consideration of appropriate dosage reduction. The following are examples of drugs known to inhibit the metabolism of other related benzodiazepines, presumably through inhibition of CYP3A: nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, and some macrolide antibiotics.








Drug interaction with fluoxetine

A multiple-dose study was conducted to assess the effect of fluoxetine 20 mg BID on the pharmacokinetics of estazolam 2 mg QHS after seven days. The pharmacokinetics of estazolam (Cmax and AUC) were not affected during multiple-dose fluoxetine, suggesting no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interaction.








Estazolam Interaction with Other Drugs That are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP)

At clinically relevant concentrations, in vitro studies indicate that estazolam (0.6µM) was not inhibitory towards the major cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A. Therefore, based on these in vitro data, estazolam is very unlikely to inhibit the biotransformation of other drugs metabolized by these CYP isoforms.","benzodiazepines, opioids, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, alcohol, barbiturates, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, narcotics, phenothiazines, psychotropic medications, carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, diltiazem, isoniazide, macrolide antibiotics, fluoxetine"

Clinically significant drug interactions with PROVAYBLUE are described below:The concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome. Although the mechanism is not clearly understood, literature reports suggest PROVAYBLUE is a potent reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Avoid concomitant use of PROVAYBLUE with medicinal products that enhance serotonergic transmission including antidepressants like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), MAOIs (monoamine oxidase inhibitors), bupropion, buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, linezolid, opioids, and dextromethorphan because of the potential for serious CNS reactions, including potentially fatal serotonin syndrome. If the intravenous use of PROVAYBLUE cannot be avoided in patients treated with serotonergic medicinal products, choose the lowest possible dose and observe the patient closely for CNS effects for up to 4 hours after administration [see Warning and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs, bupropion, buspirone, clomipramine, mirtazapine, linezolid, opioids, dextromethorphan"

Table 5 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets. 

Table 5: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets








Alcohol





Clinical Impact:


 The concomitant use of alcohol with Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets can result in an increase of oxymorphone plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of oxymorphone.




Intervention:


 Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products   containing alcohol while on Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets therapy [see Clinical   Pharmacology (12.3)].





Benzodiazepines and other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants





Clinical Impact:


 Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants   including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma,   and death.




Intervention:


Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.3)].




Examples:


 Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general   anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs





Clinical Impact:


 The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has   resulted in serotonin syndrome.




Intervention:


 If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and   dose adjustment. Discontinue Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets if serotonin   syndrome is suspected.




Examples:


 Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs),   tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin   neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e.,   cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric   disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)





Clinical Impact:


 MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory   depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].




Intervention:


 The use of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are not recommended for patients   taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.




Examples:


 phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics





Clinical Impact:


 May reduce the analgesic effect of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and/or   precipitate withdrawal symptoms.




Intervention:


 Avoid concomitant use.




Examples:


 butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine





Diuretics





Clinical Impact:


 Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.




Intervention:


 Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage  of the diuretic as needed.





Muscle Relaxants





Clinical Impact:


 Oxymorphone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce   an increased degree of respiratory depression.




Intervention:


Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].



 Examples:
 cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone




Anticholinergic Drugs





Clinical Impact:


 The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe   constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.




Intervention:


 Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Oxymorphone   Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.





Cimetidine





Clinical Impact:


 Cimetidine can potentiate opioid-induced respiratory depression.




Intervention:


 Evaluate patients for respiratory depression when Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets   and cimetidine are used concurrently.











Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue Oxymorphone Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7)

VEMLIDY is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Drugs that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in VEMLIDY absorption. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug-drug interactions. (7)







7.1	Potential for Other Drugs to Affect VEMLIDY

VEMLIDY is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and BCRP. Drugs that strongly affect P-gp and BCRP activity may lead to changes in tenofovir alafenamide absorption (see Table 4). Drugs that induce P-gp activity are expected to decrease the absorption of tenofovir alafenamide, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect of VEMLIDY. Coadministration of VEMLIDY with other drugs that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may increase the absorption and plasma concentration of tenofovir alafenamide.








7.2 	Drugs Affecting Renal Function

Because tenofovir is primarily excreted by the kidneys by a combination of glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion, coadministration of VEMLIDY with drugs that reduce renal function or compete for active tubular secretion may increase concentrations of tenofovir and other renally eliminated drugs and this may increase the risk of adverse reactions. Some examples of drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir, aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].








7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions

Table 4 provides a listing of established or potentially clinically significant drug interactions. The drug interactions described are based on studies conducted with tenofovir alafenamide or are predicted drug interactions that may occur with VEMLIDY [For magnitude of interaction, see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including selective Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors): In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors with agents that affect the RAAS, including aliskiren, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving aliskiren and NSAID therapy.

      

 
The antihypertensive effect of aliskiren may be attenuated by NSAIDs.


Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS): The concomitant use of aliskiren with other agents acting on the RAAS such as ACEIs or ARBs is associated with an increased risk of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of aliskiren with ACE inhibitors or ARBs, particularly in patients with CrCl less than 60 mL/min.

Effects of Armodafinil on CYP3A4/5 Substrates

 The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by armodafinil via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure. Dosage adjustment of these drugs should be considered when these drugs are used concomitantly with armodafinil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 The effectiveness of steroidal contraceptives may be reduced when used with armodafinil and for one month after discontinuation of therapy. Alternative or concomitant methods of contraception are recommended for patients taking steroidal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) when treated concomitantly with armodafinil and for one month after discontinuation of armodafinil treatment.
 Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with armodafinil. Monitoring of circulating cyclosporine concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustment for cyclosporine should be considered when used concomitantly with armodafinil.

 Effects of Armodafinil on CYP2C19 Substrates

 Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by armodafinil via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure. Dose reduction of these drugs may be required when these drugs are used concomitantly with armodafinil.

 Warfarin

 More frequent monitoring of prothrombin times/INR should be considered whenever armodafinil is coadministered with warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

CYP 3A4 inhibitors (e.g., Macrolide Antibiotics and Protease Inhibitors)
  There have been rare reports of serious adverse events in connection with the coadministration of certain ergot alkaloid drugs (e.g., dihydroergotamine and ergotamine) and potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors, resulting in vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Although there have been no reports of such interactions with methylergonovine alone, potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should not be coadministered with methylergonovine. Examples of some of the more potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors include macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin), HIV protease or reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine) or azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole). Less potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors should be administered with caution. Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole. These lists are not exhaustive, and the prescriber should consider the effects on CYP 3A4 of other agents being considered for concomitant use with methylergonovine.

 

CYP3A4 inducers
  Drugs (e.g. nevirapine, rifampicin) that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 are likely to decrease the pharmacological action of methylergonovine maleate.

 

Beta-blockers
  Caution should be exercised when methylergonovine maleate is used concurrently with beta-blockers. Concomitant administration with beta-blockers may enhance the vasoconstrictive action of ergot alkaloids.

 

Anesthetics
  Anesthetics like halothan and methoxyfluran may reduce the oxytocic potency of methylergonovine maleate.

 

Glyceryl trinitrate and other antianginal drugs
  Methylergonovine maleate produces vasoconstriction and can be expected to reduce the effect of glyceryl trinitrate and other antianginal drugs.

 
No pharmacokinetic interactions involving other cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are known.
Caution should be exercised when methylergonovine maleate is used concurrently with other vasoconstrictors, ergot alkaloids, or prostaglandins.","erythromycin, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, delavirdine, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, clotrimazole, nevirapine, rifampicin, halothan, methoxyfluran, glyceryl trinitrate"

7.1 Increased Toxicity with Concomitant Use of Antiretroviral Drugs


Pancreatitis
In patients with HIV infection during therapy with hydroxyurea and didanosine, with or without stavudine, fatal and nonfatal pancreatitis have occurred. Hydroxyurea is not indicated for the treatment of HIV infection; however, if patients with HIV infection are treated with hydroxyurea, and in particular, in combination with didanosine and/or stavudine, close monitoring for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis is recommended. Permanently discontinue therapy with hydroxyurea in patients who develop signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.
Hepatotoxicity
Hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure resulting in death have been reported during postmarketing surveillance in patients with HIV infection treated with hydroxyurea and other antiretroviral drugs. Fatal hepatic events were reported most often in patients treated with the combination of hydroxyurea, didanosine, and stavudine. Avoid this combination.
Peripheral Neuropathy
Peripheral neuropathy, which was severe in some cases, has been reported in patients with HIV infection receiving hydroxyurea in combination with antiretroviral drugs, including didanosine, with or without stavudine.

Voriconazole is metabolized by cytochrome P450 isoenzymes, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4. Therefore, inhibitors or inducers of these isoenzymes may increase or decrease voriconazole plasma concentrations, respectively. Voriconazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, and also inhibits CYP2C19 and CYP2C9. Therefore, Voriconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of substances metabolized by these CYP450 isoenzymes.

Metabolism of a number of medications, including antipsychotics, antidepressants, ß-blockers, and antiarrhythmics, occurs through the cytochrome P450 2D6 isoenzyme (debrisoquine hydroxylase). Approximately 10% of the Caucasian population has reduced activity of this enzyme, so-called ""poor"" metabolizers. Among other populations the prevalence is not known. Poor metabolizers demonstrate higher plasma concentrations of antipsychotic drugs at usual doses, which may correlate with emergence of side effects. In one study of 45 elderly patients suffering from dementia treated with perphenazine, the 5 patients who were prospectively identified as poor P450 2D6 metabolizers had reported significantly greater side effects during the first 10 days of treatment than the 40 extensive metabolizers, following which the groups tended to converge. Prospective phenotyping of elderly patients prior to antipsychotic treatment may identify those at risk for adverse events.
The concomitant administration of other drugs that inhibit the activity of P450 2D6 may acutely increase plasma concentrations of antipsychotics. Among these are tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine. When prescribing these drugs to patients already receiving antipsychotic therapy, close monitoring is essential and dose reduction may become necessary to avoid toxicity.

Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Morphine Sulfate Extended-Release Capsules








Alcohol






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of alcohol with morphine sulfate extended-release capsules can result in an increase of morphine plasma levels and potentially fatal overdose of morphine.





Intervention:



Instruct patients not to consume alcoholic beverages or use prescription or non-prescription products containing alcohol while on morphine sulfate extended-release capsules therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].






Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants






Clinical Impact:



Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.





Intervention:



Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.





Examples:



Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release capsules if serotonin syndrome is suspected.





Examples:



Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].





Intervention:



Do not use morphine sulfate extended-release capsules in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.

Clinical Impact:



May reduce the analgesic effect of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.





Intervention:



Avoid concomitant use.





Examples:



butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine





Muscle Relaxants






Clinical Impact:



Morphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.





Intervention:



Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose.





 Examples:

cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone 




Cimetidine






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of cimetidine can potentiate morphine effects and increase risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.





Intervention:



Evaluate patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and/or cimetidine as necessary.





Diuretics 






Clinical Impact: 



Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone. 





Intervention: 



Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed. 





Anticholinergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.





Intervention:



Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when morphine sulfate extended-release capsules are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.





P-Glycoprotein (PGP-Inhibitors) 






Clinical Impact: 



The concomitant use of PGP-inhibitors can increase the exposure to morphine by about two-fold and can increase risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death. 





Intervention: 



Evaluate patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of morphine sulfate extended-release capsules and/or the PGP-inhibitor as necessary. 











Serotonergic Drugs: Concomitant use may result in serotonin syndrome. Discontinue morphine sulfate extended-release capsules if serotonin syndrome is suspected. (7) 

Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs): Can potentiate effects of morphine. Avoid concomitant use in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping treatment with an MAOI. (7)

7.1 Digoxin

Concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets and digoxin did not affect the pharmacokinetics of either drug [
see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].








7.2 Drugs Eliminated by Active Tubular Secretion

Although demonstrated in a drug-drug interaction study not to affect the pharmacokinetics of digoxin, trospium chloride tablets has the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs that are eliminated by active tubular secretion (e.g., procainamide, pancuronium, morphine, vancomycin, and tenofovir). Coadministration of trospium chloride tablets with these drugs may increase the serum concentration of trospium chloride tablets and/or the coadministered drug due to competition for this elimination pathway. Careful patient monitoring is recommended in patients receiving such drugs [
see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
].








7.3 Antimuscarinic Agents

The concomitant use of trospium chloride tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Trospium chloride tablets may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility.








7.4 Metformin

Co-administration of 500 mg metformin immediate release tablets twice daily with trospium chloride 60 mg extended release reduced the steady-state systemic exposure of trospium by approximately 29% for mean AUC0-24 and by 34% for mean Cmax [

 TERIFLUNOMIDE tablets, for oral use Initial U.S. Approval: 2012",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


Effect of Teriflunomide on CYP2C8 Substrates

 Teriflunomide is an inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vivo. In patients taking teriflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2C8 (e.g., paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP2C8 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Effect of Teriflunomide on Warfarin

 Coadministration of teriflunomide with warfarin requires close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR) because teriflunomide may decrease peak INR by approximately 25%.

 Effect of Teriflunomide on Oral Contraceptives

 Teriflunomide may increase the systemic exposures of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. Consideration should be given to the type or dose of contraceptives used in combination with teriflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Effect of Teriflunomide on CYP1A2 Substrates

 Teriflunomide may be a weak inducer of CYP1A2 in vivo. In patients taking teriflunomide, exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP1A2 (e.g., alosetron, duloxetine, theophylline, tizanidine) may be reduced. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) metabolized by CYP1A2 as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Effect of Teriflunomide on Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) Substrates

 Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of OAT3 in vivo. In patients taking teriflunomide, exposure of drugs which are OAT3 substrates (e.g., cefaclor, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, ketoprofen, furosemide, methotrexate, zidovudine) may be increased. Monitor these patients and adjust the dose of the concomitant drug(s) which are OAT3 substrates as required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Effect of Teriflunomide on BCRP and Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptide B1 and B3 (OATP1B1/1B3) Substrates

 Teriflunomide inhibits the activity of BCRP and OATP1B1/1B3 in vivo. For a patient taking teriflunomide, the dose of rosuvastatin should not exceed 10 mg once daily. For other substrates of BCRP (e.g., mitoxantrone) and drugs in the OATP family (e.g., methotrexate, rifampin), especially HMG-Co reductase inhibitors (e.g., atorvastatin, nateglinide, pravastatin, repaglinide, and simvastatin), consider reducing the dose of these drugs and monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of increased exposures to the drugs while patients are taking teriflunomide [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Dose adjustment of other sensitive CYP3A substrates (e.g., lovastatin) and CYP3A substrates with a narrow therapeutic range (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, sirolimus) may be required as ranolazine extended-release tablets may increase plasma concentrations of these drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Drugs Transported by P-gp

 Concomitant use of ranolazine and digoxin results in increased exposure to digoxin. The dose of digoxin may have to be adjusted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

 The exposure to CYP2D6 substrates, such as tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics, may be increased during co-administration with ranolazine extended-release tablets, and lower doses of these drugs may be required.

 Drugs Transported by OCT2

 In subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, concomitant use of ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily and metformin results in increased plasma levels of metformin. When ranolazine extended-release tablets 1000 mg twice daily is co-administered with metformin, metformin dose should not exceed 1700 mg/day.

	Effect of Other Drugs on Tasigna


Strong CYP3A Inhibitors

Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor increased nilotinib concentrations compared to Tasigna alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of Tasigna toxicities. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Tasigna. If patients must be coadministered a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduce Tasigna dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.8)].

Strong CYP3A Inducers

Concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inducer decreased nilotinib concentrations compared to Tasigna alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce Tasigna efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers with Tasigna.

Proton Pump Inhibitors

Concomitant use with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) decreased nilotinib concentrations compared to Tasigna alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce Tasigna efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of PPI with Tasigna. As an alternative to PPIs, use H2 blockers approximately 10 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna, or use antacids approximately 2 hours before or approximately 2 hours after the dose of Tasigna.

Greater myelosuppression is also likely to be seen when Topotecan Injection is used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, thereby necessitating a dose reduction. However, when combining topotecan with platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin or carboplatin), a distinct sequence-dependent interaction on myelosuppression has been reported. Coadministration of a platinum agent on day 1 of dosing with topotecan required lower doses of each agent compared to co-administration on day 5 of the dosing schedule for topotecan.

Table 3 includes clinically significant drug interactions with buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions 






Benzodiazepines or other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants






Clinical Impact:



Due to additive pharmacologic effects, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.





Intervention:



Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.
 Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].
If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (

5


.2



)].






Examples:



Alcohol, benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, and other opioids.





Inhibitors of CYP3A4






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of buprenorphine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets is achieved.
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], potentially resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to buprenorphine.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of buprenorphine sublingual tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.
If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the buprenorphine sublingual tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.





Examples:



Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)





CYP3A4 Inducers






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of buprenorphine and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of buprenorphine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], potentially resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to buprenorphine.
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the buprenorphine plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both therapeutic effects and adverse reactions and may cause serious respiratory depression.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the buprenorphine sublingual tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.
If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider buprenorphine sublingual tablets dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.





Examples:



Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin





Antiretrovirals: Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)






Clinical Impact:



Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) are metabolized principally by CYP3A4. Efavirenz, nevirapine, and etravirine are known CYP3A inducers, whereas delavirdine is a CYP3A inhibitor. Significant pharmacokinetic interactions between NNRTIs (e.g., efavirenz and delavirdine) and buprenorphine have been shown in clinical studies, but these pharmacokinetic interactions did not result in any significant pharmacodynamic effects.





Intervention:



Patients who are on chronic buprenorphine sublingual tablets treatment should have their dose monitored if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen.





Examples:



efavirenz, nevirapine, etravirine, delavirdine





Antiretrovirals: Protease inhibitors (PIs)






Clinical Impact:



Studies have shown some antiretroviral protease inhibitors (PIs) with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (nelfinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir) have little effect on buprenorphine pharmacokinetic and no significant pharmacodynamic effects. Other PIs with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity (atazanavir and atazanavir/ritonavir) resulted in elevated levels of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, and patients in one study reported increased sedation. Symptoms of opioid excess have been found in postmarketing reports of patients receiving buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir concomitantly.





Intervention:



Monitor patients taking buprenorphine sublingual tablets and atazanavir with and without ritonavir, and reduce dose of buprenorphine sublingual tablets if warranted.





Examples:



atazanavir, ritonavir





Antiretrovirals: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)






Clinical Impact:



Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) do not appear to induce or inhibit the P450 enzyme pathway, thus no interactions with buprenorphine are expected.





Intervention:



None





Serotonergic Drugs







Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue buprenorphine sublingual tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.





Examples:



Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma).





Intervention:



The use of buprenorphine sublingual tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.





Examples:



phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Muscle Relaxants






Clinical Impact:



Buprenorphine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.





Intervention:



Monitor patients receiving muscle relaxants and buprenorphine sublingual tablets for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of buprenorphine sublingual tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].





Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase the risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when buprenorphine sublingual tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.











Benzodiazepines: Use caution in prescribing buprenorphine sublingual tablets for patients receiving benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants and warn patients against concomitant self-administration/misuse. (7)

CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers: Monitor patients starting or ending CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers for potential over- or under- dosing. (7)

Antiretrovirals: Patients who are on chronic buprenorphine treatment should have their dose monitored if NNRTIs are added to their treatment regimen. Monitor patients taking buprenorphine and atazanavir with and without ritonavir, and reduce dose of buprenorphine if warranted. (7)

Co-administration with probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of ertapenem and is therefore not recommended. (7.1)
The concomitant use of ertapenem and valproic acid/divalproex sodium is generally not recommended. Anti-bacterials other than carbapenems should be considered to treat infections in patients whose seizures are well controlled on valproic acid or divalproex sodium. (5.2, 7.2)








7.1 Probenecid

Probenecid interferes with the active tubular secretion of ertapenem, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of ertapenem [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of probenecid with ertapenem is not recommended.








7.2 Valproic Acid

Case reports in the literature have shown that co-administration of carbapenems, including ertapenem, to patients receiving valproic acid or divalproex sodium results in a reduction of valproic acid concentrations. The valproic acid concentrations may drop below the therapeutic range as a result of this interaction, therefore increasing the risk of breakthrough seizures. Although the mechanism of this interaction is unknown, data from in vitro and animal studies suggest that carbapenems may inhibit the hydrolysis of valproic acid's glucuronide metabolite (VPA-g) back to valproic acid, thus decreasing the serum concentrations of valproic acid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].","Probenecid,Valproic Acid,Divalproex Sodium"

CYP2D6 Substrates: Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index. If an alternative treatment cannot be used, exercise caution and consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate. (7.2)









7.1 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4 Enzymes


Based on
 
  in vitrodata, abiraterone acetate is a substrate of CYP3A4.

 
In a dedicated drug interaction trial, co-administration of rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, decreased exposure of abiraterone by 55%. Avoid concomitant strong CYP3A4 inducers during abiraterone acetate treatment. If a strong CYP3A4 inducer must be co-administered, increase the abiraterone acetate dosing frequency

7.2 Effects of Abiraterone on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes


Abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of the hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2D6 and CYP2C8. In a CYP2D6 drug-drug interaction trial, the C
 
  maxand AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8- and 2.9-fold, respectively, when dextromethorphan was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily and prednisone 5 mg twice daily. Avoid co-administration of abiraterone acetate with substrates of CYP2D6 with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., thioridazine). If alternative treatments cannot be used, consider a dose reduction of the concomitant CYP2D6 substrate drug
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]

Effect of Other Drugs on Abiraterone Acetate Tablets


Strong CYP3A4 inducers:In a clinical pharmacokinetic interaction study of healthy subjects pretreated with a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin, 600 mg daily for 6 days) followed by a single dose of abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg, the mean plasma AUC
 
  ∞of abiraterone was decreased by 55%.

 

Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors:Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of abiraterone.

 

Effect of Abiraterone Acetate Tablets on Other Drugs


CYP2D6 substrates: The C
  
   maxand AUC of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) were increased 2.8-and 2.9-fold, respectively when dextromethorphan 30 mg was given with abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily). The AUC for dextrorphan, the active metabolite of dextromethorphan, increased approximately 1.3 fold. 
   



CYP1A2 substrates: When abiraterone acetate 1,000 mg daily (plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily) was given with a single dose of 100 mg theophylline (CYP1A2 substrate), no increase in systemic exposure of theophylline was observed. 
   



CYP2C8 substrates: The AUC of pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate) was increased by 46% when pioglitazone was given to healthy subjects with a single dose of 1,000 mg abiraterone acetate.


In Vitro Studies


Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Abiraterone is a substrate of CYP3A4 and has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP2C8 and to a lesser extent CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5.


Transporter Systems: In vitrostudies show that at clinically relevant concentrations, abiraterone acetate and abiraterone are not substrates of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and that abiraterone acetate is an inhibitor of P-gp.
 
  In vitro,abiraterone and its major metabolites were shown to inhibit the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1. There are no clinical data available to confirm transporter based interaction.","rifampin, ketoconazole, dextromethorphan, thioridazine, pioglitazone, theophylline"

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABAA sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.
If clorazepate dipotassium is to be combined with other drugs acting on the central nervous system, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed. Animal experience indicates that clorazepate dipotassium prolongs the sleeping time after hexobarbital or after ethyl alcohol, increases the inhibitory effects of chlorpromazine, but does not exhibit monoamine oxidase inhibition. Clinical studies have shown increased sedation with concurrent hypnotic medications. The actions of the benzodiazepines may be potentiated by barbiturates, narcotics, phenothiazines, monoamine oxidase inhibitors or other antidepressants.
If clorazepate dipotassium tablets are used to treat anxiety associated with somatic disease states, careful attention must be paid to possible drug interaction with concomitant medication.
In bioavailability studies with normal subjects, the concurrent administration of antacids at therapeutic levels did not significantly influence the bioavailability of clorazepate dipotassium tablets.






Pregnancy





Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to psychiatric medications, including clorazepate dipotassium, during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Psychiatric Medications at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/pregnancyregistry/.








Risk Summary

Neonates born to mothers using benzodiazepines late in pregnancy have been reported to experience symptoms of sedation and/or neonatal withdrawal (see
 
  
WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome
and
 
  
Clinical Considerations
). Available data from published observational studies of pregnant women exposed to benzodiazepines do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects
 
  (see
  
   Data)
 
  .

 
The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively.








Clinical Considerations





Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression, hypotonia, and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to clorazepate dipotassium during pregnancy or labor for signs of sedation, respiratory depression, hypotonia, and feeding problems. Monitor neonates exposed to clorazepate dipotassium during pregnancy for signs of withdrawal. Manage these neonates accordingly (see
 
  
WARNINGS: Neonatal Sedation and Withdrawal Syndrome
).

 










Data





Human Data

Published data from observational studies on the use of benzodiazepines during pregnancy do not report a clear association with benzodiazepines and major birth defects. Although early studies reported an increased risk of congenital malformations with diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, there was no consistent pattern noted. In addition, the majority of more recent case-control and cohort studies of benzodiazepine use during pregnancy, which were adjusted for confounding exposures to alcohol, tobacco and other medications, have not confirmed these findings.








Animal Data

In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of clorazepate to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses up to 150 and 15 mg/kg, respectively, did not cause fetal toxicities or malformation. However, the sedative effects of high dose clorazepate interfered with the maternal care of the offspring.












Nursing Mothers





Risk Summary

Clorazepate and its active metabolite, nordiazepam, are present in breast milk. There are reports of sedation, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk. The effects of clorazepate on milk production are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions, including sedation and withdrawal symptoms in infants, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with clorazepate dipotassium.










Pediatric Use

See
 
  
WARNINGS
.

 








Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of clorazepate dipotassium were not adequate to determine whether subjects aged 65 and over respond differently than younger subjects. Elderly or debilitated patients may be especially sensitive to the effects of all benzodiazepines, including clorazepate dipotassium. In general, elderly or debilitated patients should be started on lower doses of clorazepate dipotassium and observed closely, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Dose adjustments should also be made slowly, and with more caution in this patient population (see

7.2 Drugs that Inhibit or Induce CYP3A4



Drugs that Inhibit CYP3A4 (Ketoconazole) 



CYP3A4 is a major metabolic pathway for elimination of eszopiclone.  The exposure of eszopiclone was increased by coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Other strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, troleandomycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir) would be expected to behave similarly. Dose reduction of eszopiclone is needed for patient co-administered eszopiclone with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors 
         
 
  [see 
          
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 
         
 
  



Drugs that Induce CYP3A4 (Rifampicin) 



Racemic zopiclone exposure was decreased 80% by concomitant use of rifampicin, a potent inducer of CYP3A4.  A similar effect would be expected with eszopiclone. Combination use with CYP3A4 inducer may decrease the exposure and effects of eszopiclone.","Ethanol,Rifampicin,Ketoconazole,Olanzapine,Itraconazole,Clarithromycin,Nefazodone,Troleandomycin,Ritonavir,Nelfinavir"

 LOKELMA® (sodium zirconium cyclosilicate) for oral suspension  Initial U.S. Approval: 2018",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

LOKELMA can transiently increase gastric pH. As a result, LOKELMA can change the absorption of co-administered drugs that exhibit pH-dependent solubility, potentially leading to altered efficacy or safety of these drugs when taken close to the time LOKELMA is administered. In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. LOKELMA is not expected to impact systemic exposure of drugs that do not exhibit pH-dependent solubility and so spacing is not needed if it has been determined that the concomitant medication does not exhibit pH-dependent solubility.





In general, other oral medications should be administered at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after LOKELMA. (2.3, 7, 12.3)Drug Interactions


Thirty-six (36) drugs were tested in-vitro to determine potential interactions with LOKELMA. Sixteen (16) drugs tested did not show an in vitro interaction with LOKELMA (allopurinol, apixaban, aspirin, captopril, cyclosporine, digoxin, ethinyl estradiol, lisinopril, magnesium, metformin, phenytoin, prednisone, propranolol, quinapril, spironolactone and ticagrelor).
Nine (9) of the 20 drugs that showed an in vitro interaction were subsequently tested in vivo with LOKELMA 10 g in healthy volunteers. Losartan, glipizide and levothyroxine did not show any changes in exposure when co-administered with LOKELMA. However, there was an increase in systemic exposure to weak acids such as furosemide and atorvastatin, and a decrease in systemic exposure to weak bases such as dabigatran when co-administered with LOKELMA, as shown in Figure 2. These changes are consistent with the hypothesis that LOKELMA, by elevating gastric pH, affects the systemic exposure of co-administered drugs whose solubility is pH-dependent [see Drug Interactions (7)].
In another drug-drug interaction study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of LOKELMA 15 g
decreased the systemic exposures of tacrolimus (Figure 2), likely due to LOKELMA’s action on elevating
gastric pH. In the same study, co-administration of LOKELMA and cyclosporine did not show a
clinically meaningful interaction.

Co-administration of ONIVYDE with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) or UGT1A1 (e.g., atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN-38. Avoid the use of strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors if possible. Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting ONIVYDE therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole, atazanavir, gemfibrozil"

7.1 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors


With other drugs that affect brain monoamine concentrations, there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal reactions (including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma) when taken in combination with an MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Such reactions may occur when these drugs are given concurrently or in close proximity [see Contraindications (4.2)].









7.2 Effect of CYP2D6 Inhibitors on Atomoxetine


In extensive metabolizers (EMs), inhibitors of CYP2D6 (e.g., paroxetine, fluoxetine, and quinidine) increase atomoxetine steady-state plasma concentrations to exposures similar to those observed in poor metabolizers (PMs). In EM individuals treated with paroxetine or fluoxetine, the AUC of atomoxetine is approximately 6- to 8-fold and Css,max is about 3- to 4-fold greater than atomoxetine alone.

In vitro studies suggest that coadministration of cytochrome P450 inhibitors to PMs will not increase the plasma concentrations of atomoxetine.








7.3 Antihypertensive Drugs and Pressor Agents

Because of possible effects on blood pressure, atomoxetine should be used cautiously with antihypertensive drugs and pressor agents (e.g., dopamine, dobutamine) or other drugs that increase blood pressure.








7.4 Albuterol


Atomoxetine should be administered with caution to patients being treated with systemically-administered (oral or intravenous) albuterol (or other beta2 agonists) because the action of albuterol on the cardiovascular system can be potentiated resulting in increases in heart rate and blood pressure. Albuterol (600 mcg iv over 2 hours) induced increases in heart rate and blood pressure. These effects were potentiated by atomoxetine (60 mg BID for 5 days) and were most marked after the initial coadministration of albuterol and atomoxetine. However, these effects on heart rate and blood pressure were not seen in another study after the coadministration with inhaled dose of albuterol (200 to 800 mcg) and atomoxetine (80 mg QD for 5 days) in 21 healthy Asian subjects who were excluded for poor metabolizer status.








7.5 Effect of Atomoxetine on P450 Enzymes


Atomoxetine did not cause clinically important inhibition or induction of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP3A, CYP2D6, and CYP2C9.

 CYP3A Substrate (e.g., Midazolam) — Coadministration of atomoxetine (60 mg BID for 12 days) with midazolam, a model compound for CYP3A4 metabolized drugs (single dose of 5 mg), resulted in 15% increase in AUC of midazolam. No dose adjustment is recommended for drugs metabolized by CYP3A. 

CYP2D6 Substrate (e.g., Desipramine)  — Coadministration of atomoxetine (40 or 60 mg BID for 13 days) with desipramine, a model compound for CYP2D6 metabolized drugs (single dose of 50 mg), did not alter the pharmacokinetics of desipramine. No dose adjustment is recommended for drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.








7.6 Alcohol


Consumption of ethanol with atomoxetine did not change the intoxicating effects of ethanol.








7.7 Methylphenidate


Coadministration of methylphenidate with atomoxetine did not increase cardiovascular effects beyond those seen with methylphenidate alone.








7.8 Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein



In vitro drug-displacement studies were conducted with atomoxetine and other highly-bound drugs at therapeutic concentrations. Atomoxetine did not affect the binding of warfarin, acetylsalicylic acid, phenytoin, or diazepam to human albumin. Similarly, these compounds did not affect the binding of atomoxetine to human albumin.

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Sorafenib Tablets


Strong CYP3A4 Inducers


The concomitant use of sorafenib tablets with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib, which may decrease the antitumor activity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib tablets with strong CYP3A4 inducers, when possible, because these drugs can decrease the systemic exposure to sorafenib.


Neomycin


The concomitant use of sorafenib tablets with neomycin decreased the mean AUC of sorafenib, which may decrease the antitumor activity. Avoid concomitant use of sorafenib tablets with neomycin. The effects of other antibiotics on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib have not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 








7.2 Concomitant Use of Warfarin

The concomitant use of sorafenib tablets and warfarin may increase the risk of bleeding or increased the INR. Monitor INR and for clinical bleeding episodes in patients taking warfarin while receiving sorafenib tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]. 








7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QT Interval

Tablets",DI,"Drug Interactions


Due to the potential for additive effects, caution and careful titration are warranted in patients receiving diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with any agents known to affect cardiac contractility and/or conduction (see
 
  
WARNINGS
).

 
Pharmacologic studies indicate that there may be additive effects in prolonging AV conduction when using beta-blockers or digitalis concomitantly with diltiazem hydrochloride (see
 
  
WARNINGS
).

 
As with all drugs, care should be exercised when treating patients with multiple medications. Diltiazem is both a substrate and an inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system. Other drugs that are specific substrates, inhibitors, or inducers of this enzyme system may have a significant impact on the efficacy and side effect profile of diltiazem. Patients taking other drugs that are substrates of CYP450 3A4, especially patients with renal and/or hepatic impairment, may require dosage adjustment when starting or stopping concomitantly administered diltiazem in order to maintain optimum therapeutic blood levels.








Anesthetics:The depression of cardiac contractility, conductivity, and automaticity, as well as the vascular dilation associated with anesthetics, may be potentiated by calcium channel blockers. When used concomitantly, anesthetics and calcium blockers should be titrated carefully.

 










Benzodiazepines:Studies showed that diltiazem increased the AUC of midazolam and triazolam by 3- to 4-fold and the C
 
  maxby 2-fold, compared to placebo. The elimination half-life of midazolam and triazolam also increased (1.5- to 2.5-fold) during coadministration with diltiazem. These pharmacokinetic effects seen during diltiazem coadministration can result in increased clinical effects (e.g., prolonged sedation) of both midazolam and triazolam.

 










Beta-blockers:Controlled and uncontrolled domestic studies suggest that concomitant use of diltiazem hydrochloride and beta-blockers is usually well tolerated. Available data are not sufficient, however, to predict the effects of concomitant treatment, particularly in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac conduction abnormalities.

 
Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride concomitantly with propranolol in five normal volunteers resulted in increased propranolol levels in all subjects, and bioavailability of propranolol was increased approximately 50%.
 
  In vitro, propranolol appears to be displaced from its binding sites by diltiazem. If combination therapy is initiated or withdrawn in conjunction with propranolol, an adjustment in the propranolol dose may be warranted (see
 
  
WARNINGS
).

 










Buspirone:In nine healthy subjects, diltiazem significantly increased the mean buspirone AUC 5.5-fold and C
 
  max4.1-fold compared to placebo. The T
 
  1/2and T
 
  maxof buspirone were not significantly affected by diltiazem. Enhanced effects and increased toxicity of buspirone may be possible during concomitant administration with diltiazem. Subsequent dose adjustments may be necessary during coadministration, and should be based on clinical assessment.

 










Carbamazepine:Concomitant administration of diltiazem with carbamazepine has been reported to result in elevated serum levels of carbamazepine (40% to 72% increase) resulting in toxicity in some cases. Patients receiving these drugs concurrently should be monitored for a potential drug interaction.

 










Cimetidine:A study in six healthy volunteers has shown a significant increase in peak diltiazem plasma levels (58%) and area-under-the-curve (53%) after a 1-week course of cimetidine at 1200 mg per day and a single dose of diltiazem 60 mg. Ranitidine produced smaller, nonsignificant increases. The effect may be mediated by cimetidine’s known inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450, the enzyme system responsible for the first-pass metabolism of diltiazem. Patients currently receiving diltiazem therapy should be carefully monitored for a change in pharmacological effect when initiating and discontinuing therapy with cimetidine. An adjustment in the diltiazem dose may be warranted.

 










Clonidine:Sinus bradycardia resulting in hospitalization and pacemaker insertion has been reported in association with the use of clonidine concurrently with diltiazem. Monitor heart rate in patients receiving concomitant diltiazem and clonidine.

 










Cyclosporine:A pharmacokinetic interaction between diltiazem and cyclosporine has been observed during studies involving renal and cardiac transplant patients. In renal and cardiac transplant recipients, a reduction of cyclosporine trough dose ranging from 15% to 48% was necessary to maintain concentrations similar to those seen prior to the addition of diltiazem. If these agents are to be administered concurrently, cyclosporine concentrations should be monitored, especially when diltiazem therapy is initiated, adjusted, or discontinued. The effect of cyclosporine on diltiazem plasma concentrations has not been evaluated.

 










Digitalis:Administration of diltiazem hydrochloride with digoxin in 24 healthy male subjects increased plasma digoxin concentrations approximately 20%. Another investigator found no increase in digoxin levels in 12 patients with coronary artery disease. Since there have been conflicting results regarding the effect of digoxin levels, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing diltiazem hydrochloride therapy to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization (see
 
  WARNINGS).

 

Ivabradine:Concurrent use of diltiazem increases exposure to ivabradine and may exacerbate bradycardia and conduction disturbances. Avoid concomitant use of ivabradine and diltiazem.

 










Quinidine:Diltiazem significantly increases the AUC
 
  (0→∞)of quinidine by 51%, T
 
  1/2by 36%, and decreases its CL
 
  oralby 33%. Monitoring for quinidine adverse effects may be warranted and the dose adjusted accordingly.

 










Rifampin:Coadministration of rifampin with diltiazem lowered the diltiazem plasma concentrations to undetectable levels. Coadministration of diltiazem with rifampin or any known CYP3A4 inducer should be avoided when possible, and alternative therapy considered.

 










Statins:Diltiazem is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and has been shown to increase significantly the AUC of some statins. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis with statins metabolized by CYP3A4 may be increased with concomitant use of diltiazem. When possible, use a non-CYP3A4-metabolized statin together with diltiazem; otherwise, dose adjustments for both diltiazem and the statin should be considered along with close monitoring for signs and symptoms of any statin-related adverse events. In a healthy volunteer crossover study (N=10), coadministration of a single 20 mg dose of simvastatin at the end of a 14-day regimen with 120 mg BID diltiazem SR resulted in a 5-fold increase in mean simvastatin AUC versus simvastatin alone. Subjects with increased average steady-state exposures of diltiazem showed a greater fold increase in simvastatin exposure. Computer-based simulations showed that at a daily dose of 480 mg of diltiazem, an 8- to 9-fold mean increase in simvastatin AUC can be expected. If coadministration of simvastatin with diltiazem is required, limit the daily doses of simvastatin to 10 mg and diltiazem to 240 mg.

 
In a ten-subject randomized, open label, 4-way crossover study, coadministration of diltiazem (120 mg BID diltiazem SR for 2 weeks) with a single 20 mg dose of lovastatin resulted in 3- to 4-fold increase in mean lovastatin AUC and Cmax versus lovastatin alone. In the same study, there was no significant change in 20 mg single dose pravastatin AUC and Cmax during diltiazem coadministration. Diltiazem plasma levels were not significantly affected by lovastatin or pravastatin.","diltiazem hydrochloride, beta-blockers, digitalis, midazolam, triazolam, propranolol, buspirone, carbamazepine, cimetidine, ranitidine, clonidine, cyclosporine, digoxin, ivabradine, quinidine, rifampin, statins, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin"

ACE-inhibitors

Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors (see
 
  
WARNINGS
).

 

Antacids

The concomitant administration of antacids has no apparent effect on the extent of absorption of etodolac. However, antacids can decrease the peak concentration reached by 15% to 20% but have no detectable effect on the time-to-peak.
Aspirin
When etodolac is administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free etodolac is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of etodolac and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.

Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate

Etodolac, like other NSAIDs, through effects on renal prostaglandins, may cause changes in the elimination of these drugs leading to elevated serum levels of cyclosporine, digoxin, methotrexate, and increased toxicity. Nephrotoxicity associated with cyclosporine may also be enhanced. Patients receiving these drugs who are given etodolac, or any other NSAID, and particularly those patients with altered renal function, should be observed for the development of the specific toxicities of these drugs. NSAIDs, such as etodolac, should not be administered prior to or concomitantly with high doses of methotrexate. NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. In general, caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

Diuretics

Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with furosemide or
hydrochlorothiazide. Nevertheless, clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations have shown that etodolac can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients with possible loss of blood pressure control. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal insufficiency or failure (see
 
  
WARNINGS, Renal Effects
), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy.

 

Glyburide

Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with glyburide.

Lithium

NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. Careful monitoring of lithium levels is advised in the event NSAID dosage adjustments are required.

Phenylbutazone

Phenylbutazone causes increase (by about 80%) in the free fraction of etodolac. Although
 
  in vivostudies have not been done to see if etodolac clearance is changed by co-administration of phenylbutazone, it is not recommended that they be co-administered.

 

Phenytoin

Etodolac has no apparent pharmacokinetic interaction when administered with phenytoin.

Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than that of users of either drug alone. Short-term pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that concomitant administration of warfarin and etodolac results in reduced protein binding of warfarin, but there was no change in the clearance of free warfarin. There was no significant difference in the pharmacodynamic effect of warfarin administered alone and warfarin administered with etodolac as measured by prothrombin time. Thus, concomitant therapy with warfarin and etodolac should not require dosage adjustment of either drug. However, caution should be exercised because there have been a few spontaneous reports of prolonged prothrombin times, with or without bleeding, in etodolac-treated patients receiving concomitant warfarin therapy. Close monitoring of such patients is therefore recommended.

Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The urine of patients who take etodolac can give a false-positive reaction for urinary bilirubin (urobilin) due to the presence of phenolic metabolites of etodolac. Diagnostic dip-stick methodology, used to detect ketone bodies in urine, has resulted in false-positive findings in some patients treated with etodolac. Generally, this phenomenon has not been associated with other clinically significant events. No dose relationship has been observed.
Etodolac treatment is associated with a small decrease in serum uric acid levels. In clinical trials, mean decreases of 1 to 2 mg/dL were observed in arthritic patients receiving etodolac (600 to 1000 mg/day) after 4 weeks of therapy. These levels then remained stable for up to 1 year of therapy.","ACE-inhibitors, Antacids, Aspirin, Cyclosporine, Digoxin, Methotrexate, Furosemide, Hydrochlorothiazide, Glyburide, Lithium, Phenylbutazone, Phenytoin, Warfarin"

In vitro studies of human CYP enzymes showed that entacapone inhibited the CYP enzymes 1A2, 2A6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A only at very high concentrations (IC50 from 200 microM to over 1,000 microM; an oral 200 mg dose achieves a highest level of approximately 5 microM in people); these enzymes would therefore not be expected to be inhibited in clinical use.
 
In an interaction study in healthy volunteers, entacapone did not significantly change the plasma levels of S-warfarin while the AUC for R-warfarin increased on average by 18% [CI90 11% to 26%], and the INR values increased on average by 13% [CI90 6% to 19%]. Nevertheless, cases of significantly increased INR in patients concomitantly using warfarin have been reported during the postapproval use of entacapone. Therefore, monitoring of INR is recommended when entacapone treatment is initiated or when the dose is increased for patients receiving warfarin.

Protein Binding

Entacapone is highly protein bound (98%). 
  In vitro studies have shown no binding displacement between entacapone and other highly bound drugs, such as warfarin, salicylic acid, phenylbutazone, and diazepam.

Effects of Other Drugs on Loperamide

Concomitant use of loperamide hydrochloride with inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., itraconazole) or CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) or inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (e.g., quinidine, ritonavir) can increase exposure to loperamide. The increased systemic exposure to loperamide may increase a risk for cardiac adverse reactions especially in patients who are taking multiple CYP enzyme inhibitors, or in patients with underlying cardiac conditions (see

CYP3A4 Inhibitors
  
Itraconazole

Concomitant administration of multiple doses of 100 mg itraconazole twice daily, an inhibitor of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein, with a single 4 mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride increased the peak plasma concentration and the systemic exposure to loperamide by 2.9-fold and 3.8-fold, respectively.

Saquinavir

When a single 16 mg dose of loperamide hydrochloride is coadministered with a 600 mg single dose of saquinavir, loperamide decreased saquinavir exposure by 54%, which may be of clinical relevance due to reduction of therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir. The effect of saquinavir on loperamide is of less clinical significance. Therefore, when loperamide is given with saquinavir, the therapeutic efficacy of saquinavir should be closely monitored.","itraconazole, gemfibrozil, quinidine, ritonavir, saquinavir"

Strong CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use. If not possible, increase TAGRISSO to 160 mg daily in patients receiving a strong CYP3A4 inducer. (2.5, 7.1)







7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Osimertinib 


Strong CYP3A Inducers

Co-administering TAGRISSO with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreased the exposure of osimertinib compared to administering TAGRISSO alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Decreased osimertinib exposure may lead to reduced efficacy.
Avoid co-administering TAGRISSO with strong CYP3A inducers. Increase the TAGRISSO dosage when co-administering with a strong CYP3A4 inducer if concurrent use is unavoidable [see 

Dosage and Administration (2.5)

]. No dose adjustments are required when TAGRISSO is used with moderate and/or weak CYP3A inducers.








7.2 Effect of Osimertinib on Other Drugs 

Co-administering TAGRISSO with a breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate increased the exposure of the substrate compared to administering it alone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Increased BCRP or P-gp substrate exposure may increase the risk of exposure-related toxicity.
Monitor for adverse reactions of the BCRP or P-gp substrate, unless otherwise instructed in its approved labeling, when co-administered with TAGRISSO.








7.3 Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval 

The effect of co-administering medicinal products known to prolong the QTc interval with TAGRISSO is unknown. When feasible, avoid concomitant administration of drugs known to prolong the QTc interval with known risk of Torsades de pointes. If not feasible to avoid concomitant administration of such drugs, conduct periodic ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",Strong CYP3A Inducers

Concomitant use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with other drugs that can lower blood pressure, reduce myocardial contractility, or interfere with sinus node function or electrical impulse propagation in the myocardium can exaggerate esmolol hydrochloride injection’s effects on blood pressure, contractility, and impulse propagation. Severe interactions with such drugs can result in, for example, severe hypotension, cardiac failure, severe bradycardia, sinus pause, sinoatrial block, atrioventricular block, and/or cardiac arrest. In addition, with some drugs, beta blockade may precipitate increased withdrawal effects. (See clonidine, guanfacine, and moxonidine below.) Esmolol hydrochloride injection should therefore be used only after careful individual assessment of the risks and expected benefits in patients receiving drugs that can cause these types of pharmacodynamic interactions, including but not limited to:
•
  
Digitalis glycosides: Concomitant administration of digoxin and esmolol hydrochloride injection leads to an approximate 10% to 20% increase of digoxin blood levels at some time points. Digoxin does not affect esmolol hydrochloride injection pharmacokinetics. Both digoxin and beta blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use increases the risk of bradycardia.
  
•
  
Anticholinesterases: Esmolol hydrochloride injection prolonged the duration of succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular blockade and moderately prolonged clinical duration and recovery index of mivacurium.
  
•
  
Antihypertensive agents clonidine, guanfacine, or moxonidine: Beta blockers also increase the risk of clonidine-, guanfacine-, or moxonidine-withdrawal rebound hypertension. If, during concomitant use of a beta blocker, antihypertensive therapy needs to be interrupted or discontinued, discontinue the beta blocker first, and the discontinuation should be gradual.
  
•
  
Calcium channel antagonists: In patients with depressed myocardial infarction, use of esmolol hydrochloride injection with cardiodepressant calcium channel antagonists (e.g., verapamil) can lead to fatal cardiac arrests.
  
•
  
Sympathomimetic drugs: Sympathomimetic drugs having beta-adrenergic agonist activity will counteract effects of esmolol hydrochloride injection.
  
•
  
Vasoconstrictive and positive inotropic agents: Because of the risk of reducing cardiac contractility in presence of high systemic vascular resistance, do not use esmolol hydrochloride injection to control tachycardia in patients receiving drugs that are vasoconstrictive and have positive inotropic effects, such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine.","clonidine, guanfacine, moxonidine, digoxin, succinylcholine, mivacurium, verapamil, epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine"

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Amphetamines


Table 5 Drugs having clinically important interactions with amphetamines. 








 
MAO Inhibitors (MAOI)

 


 Clinical Impact 
 MAOI antidepressants slow amphetamine metabolism, increasing amphetamines effect on the release of norepinephrine and other monoamines from adrenergic nerve endings causing headaches and other signs of hypertensive crisis. Toxic neurological effects and malignant hyperpyrexia can occur, sometimes with fatal results. 


 Intervention  
 Do not administer lisdexamfetamine dimesylate during or within 14 days following the administration of MAOI [see Contraindications (4)].  


 
Serotonergic Drugs

 


 Clinical Impact  
 The concomitant use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.  


 Intervention  
 Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during lisdexamfetamine dimesylate initiation or dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and the concomitant serotonergic drug(s) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].  


 
CYP2D6 Inhibitors

 


 Clinical Impact  
 The concomitant use of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and CYP2D6 inhibitors may increase the exposure of dextroamphetamine, the active metabolite of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate compared to the use of the drug alone and increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.  


 Intervention  
 Initiate with lower doses and monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome particularly during lisdexamfetamine dimesylate initiation and after a dosage increase. If serotonin syndrome occurs, discontinue lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and the CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) and Overdosage (10)].  


 
Alkalinizing Agents 

 


 Clinical Impact  
 Urinary alkalinizing agents can increase blood levels and potentiate the action of amphetamine.  


 Intervention  
 Co-administration of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate and urinary alkalinizing agents should be avoided.  


 
Acidifying Agents 

 


 Clinical Impact  
 Urinary acidifying agents can lower blood levels and efficacy of amphetamines.  


 Intervention  
 Increase dose based on clinical response.  


 
Tricyclic Antidepressants 

 


 Clinical Impact 
 May enhance the activity of tricyclic or sympathomimetic agents causing striking and sustained increases in the concentration of d-amphetamine in the brain; cardiovascular effects can be potentiated. 


 Intervention  
 Monitor frequently and adjust or use alternative therapy based on clinical response. 











7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with Lisdexamfetamine Dimesylate


From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is necessary when lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is co-administered with guanfacine, venlafaxine, or omeprazole. In addition, no dose adjustment of guanfacine or venlafaxine is needed when lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

From a pharmacokinetic perspective, no dose adjustment for drugs that are substrates of CYP1A2 (e.g., theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin), CYP2D6 (e.g., atomoxetine, desipramine, venlafaxine), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, lansoprazole, clobazam), and CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin) is necessary when lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is co-administered [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","MAO Inhibitors, Serotonergic Drugs, CYP2D6 Inhibitors, Alkalinizing Agents, Acidifying Agents, Tricyclic Antidepressants, guanfacine, venlafaxine, omeprazole, theophylline, duloxetine, melatonin, atomoxetine, desipramine, lansoprazole, clobazam, midazolam, pimozide, simvastatin"

7.1 Tamoxifen

Co-administration of anastrozole and tamoxifen in breast cancer patients reduced anastrozole plasma concentration by 27%. However, the coadministration of anastrozole and tamoxifen did not affect the pharmacokinetics of tamoxifen or N-desmethyltamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the combination of anastrozole tablets and tamoxifen did not demonstrate any efficacy benefit when compared with tamoxifen in all patients as well as in the hormone receptor-positive subpopulation. This treatment arm was discontinued from the trial
 
  [see Clinical Studies (
  
   14.1)].
 
  Based on clinical and pharmacokinetic results from the ATAC trial, tamoxifen should not be administered with anastrozole.

 







7.2 Estrogen

Estrogen-containing therapies should not be used with anastrozole tablets as they may diminish its pharmacological action.







7.3 Warfarin

In a study conducted in 16 male volunteers, anastrozole did not alter the exposure (as measured by C

7.1 Cholestyramine


Concomitant administration of cholestyramine with raloxifene hydrochloride is not recommended. Although not specifically studied, it is anticipated that other anion exchange resins would have a similar effect. Raloxifene hydrochloride should not be co-administered with other anion exchange resins [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

While the chelation by divalent cations is less marked than with other fluoroquinolones, concurrent administration of levofloxacin tablets with antacids containing magnesium, or aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamin preparations with zinc may interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. Tablets with antacids containing magnesium, aluminum, as well as sucralfate, metal cations such as iron, and multivitamins preparations with zinc or didanosine may substantially interfere with the gastrointestinal absorption of levofloxacin, resulting in systemic levels considerably lower than desired. These agents should be taken at least two hours before or two hours after oral levofloxacin administration. 
        

 








7.2       Warfarin
        

 


No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for R- and S- warfarin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of warfarin on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, there have been reports during the postmarketing experience in patients that levofloxacin enhances the effects of warfarin. Elevations of the prothrombin time in the setting of concurrent warfarin and levofloxacin use have been associated with episodes of bleeding. Prothrombin time, International Normalized Ratio (INR), or other suitable anticoagulation tests should be closely monitored if levofloxacin is administered concomitantly with warfarin. Patients should also be monitored for evidence of bleeding [see

Disturbances of blood glucose, including hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, have been reported in patients treated concomitantly with fluoroquinolones and an antidiabetic agent. Therefore, careful monitoring of blood glucose is recommended when these agents are co-administered [see Warnings and Precautions (

7.4       Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs
        

 


The concomitant administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with a fluoroquinolone, including levofloxacin, may increase the risk of CNS stimulation and convulsive seizures [see Warnings and Precautions
         
 
   (5.4)]
        

 








7.5       Theophylline
        

 


No significant effect of levofloxacin on the plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for theophylline was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Similarly, no apparent effect of theophylline on levofloxacin absorption and disposition was observed. However, concomitant administration of other fluoroquinolones with theophylline has resulted in prolonged elimination half-life, elevated serum theophylline levels, and a subsequent increase in the risk of theophylline-related adverse reactions in the patient population. Therefore, theophylline levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made when levofloxacin is co-administered. Adverse reactions, including seizures, may occur with or without an elevation in serum theophylline levels [see Warnings and Precautions (
         
 
  5.4)]
        

 








7.6       Cyclosporine
        

 


No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for cyclosporine was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. However, elevated serum levels of cyclosporine have been reported in the patient population when co-administered with some other fluoroquinolones. Levofloxacin Cmax and k
         
 
  e were slightly lower while Tmax and t
         
 
  ½ were slightly longer in the presence of cyclosporine than those observed in other studies without concomitant medication. The differences, however, are not considered to be clinically significant. Therefore, no dosage adjustment is required for levofloxacin or cyclosporine when administered concomitantly.
        

 








7.7       Digoxin
        

 


No significant effect of levofloxacin on the peak plasma concentrations, AUC, and other disposition parameters for digoxin was detected in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. Levofloxacin absorption and disposition kinetics were similar in the presence or absence of digoxin. Therefore, no dosage adjustment for levofloxacin or digoxin is required when administered concomitantly. 








7.8       Probenecid and Cimetidine
        

 


No significant effect of probenecid or cimetidine on the Cmax of levofloxacin was observed in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers. The AUC and t
         
 
  ½ of levofloxacin were higher while CL/F and CL
         
 
  R were lower during concomitant treatment of levofloxacin with probenecid or cimetidine compared to levofloxacin alone. However, these changes do not warrant dosage adjustment for levofloxacinwhen probenecid or cimetidine is co-administered. 
        

 








7.9       Interactions with Laboratory or Diagnostic Testing
        

 


Some fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, may produce false-positive urine screening results for opiates using commercially available immunoassay kits.

•Lithium: Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity (7).

•NSAIDS use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7).

•Combined inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system:  Increased risk of renal impairment, hypotension, and hyperkalemia (7).








7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium 

Co-administration of candesartan cilexetil with potassium sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.








7.2 Lithium 

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan cilexetil.  Monitor serum lithium levels.








7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors) 

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure.  These effects are usually reversible.  Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving candesartan and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including candesartan may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.








7.4 Combination Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) 

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.  Triple combination of ATACAND with an ACE-inhibitor and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist is generally not recommended.  Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on candesartan cilexetil and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not co-administer aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with diabetes.  Avoid use of aliskiren with candesartan cilexetil in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min) [see Contraindications (4)].","Lithium,NSAIDs,potassium sparing diuretics,potassium supplements,potassium-containing salt substitutes,Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors,COX-2 Inhibitors,angiotensin receptor blockers,ACE inhibitors,aliskiren"

7.1 Drugs that Make the Urine Alkaline

The clearance of memantine was reduced by about 80% under alkaline urine conditions at pH 8. Therefore, alterations of urine pH towards the alkaline condition may lead to an accumulation of the drug with a possible increase in adverse effects. Urine pH is altered by diet, drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate) and clinical state of the patient (e.g., renal tubular acidosis or severe infections of the urinary tract). Hence, memantine should be used with caution under these conditions.








7.2 Use with Other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Antagonists

The combined use of memantine hydrochloride with other NMDA antagonists (amantadine, ketamine, and dextromethorphan) has not been systematically evaluated and such use should be approached with caution.","carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, sodium bicarbonate, amantadine, ketamine, dextromethorphan"

CYP3A4 inhibitors increase exposure to lomitapide. Strong and moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors are contraindicated with JUXTAPID. Patients must avoid grapefruit juice  (4, 										 5.6, 										 7.1).
When administered with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dose of JUXTAPID should be decreased by half. The dosage of JUXTAPID may then be up-titrated to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily (2.3, 										5.6, 										7.2). 
Warfarin: Lomitapide increases plasma concentrations of warfarin. Monitor international normalized ratio (INR) regularly, especially with JUXTAPID dose adjustment (5.8, 										 7.3).
Simvastatin and lovastatin exposure increase with JUXTAPID.  Limit dose when co-administered with JUXTAPID due to myopathy risk (5.7, 										 7.4).
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) Substrates: Consider dose reduction of P-gp substrate because of possible increased absorption with JUXTAPID (7.5).
Bile Acid Sequestrants: Separate JUXTAPID dosing by at least 4 hours (7.6).








7.1	Moderate and Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

A strong CYP3A4 inhibitor has been shown to increase lomitapide exposure approximately 27-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, tipranavir/ritonavir, voriconazole) with lomitapide is contraindicated. Concomitant use of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil) has not been studied, but concomitant use with lomitapide is contraindicated since lomitapide exposure will likely increase significantly in the presence of these inhibitors.
Patients must avoid grapefruit juice while taking JUXTAPID [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2	Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, cyclosporine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ginkgo, goldenseal, isoniazid, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ranitidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, zileuton) can increase lomitapide exposure approximately 2-fold [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When administered with weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dose of JUXTAPID should be decreased by half. Careful titration of JUXTAPID may then be considered based on LDL-C response and safety/tolerability to a maximum recommended dosage of 30 mg daily except when coadministered with oral contraceptives, in which case the maximum recommended lomitapide dosage is 40 mg daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.3),	 Warnings and Precautions (5.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3	Warfarin

Lomitapide increases plasma concentrations of both R(+)-warfarin and S(-)-warfarin by approximately 30% and increased the INR 22%. Patients taking warfarin should undergo regular monitoring of INR, particularly after any changes in lomitapide dosage. The dose of warfarin should be adjusted as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].








7.4	Simvastatin and Lovastatin

The risk of myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, with simvastatin and lovastatin monotherapy is dose related. Lomitapide approximately doubles the exposure of simvastatin; therefore, the recommended dose of simvastatin should be reduced by 50% when initiating JUXTAPID [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. While taking JUXTAPID, limit simvastatin dosage to 20 mg daily (or 40 mg daily for patients who have previously tolerated simvastatin 80 mg daily for at least one year without evidence of muscle toxicity). Refer to the simvastatin prescribing information for simvastatin dosing recommendations.
Interaction between lovastatin and lomitapide has not been studied. However, the metabolizing enzymes and transporters responsible for the disposition of lovastatin and simvastatin are similar, suggesting that JUXTAPID may increase the exposure of lovastatin; therefore, reducing the dose of lovastatin should be considered when initiating JUXTAPID.








7.5	P-glycoprotein Substrates

Lomitapide is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Coadministration of lomitapide with P-gp substrates (such as aliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, imatinib, lapatinib, maraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sirolimus, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan, topotecan) may increase the absorption of P-gp substrates. Dose reduction of the P-gp substrate should be considered when used concomitantly with lomitapide.








7.6	Bile Acid Sequestrants

JUXTAPID has not been tested for interaction with bile acid sequestrants. Administration of JUXTAPID and bile acid sequestrants should be separated by at least 4 hours since bile acid sequestrants can interfere with the absorption of oral medications.","boceprevir, clarithromycin, conivaptan, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, tipranavir, voriconazole, amprenavir, aprepitant, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, crizotinib, darunavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, imatinib, verapamil, grapefruit juice, alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, atorvastatin, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, cyclosporine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, ginkgo, goldenseal, isoniazid, lapatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, ranitidine, ranolazine, ticagrelor, zileuton, warfarin, simvastatin, lovastatin, aliskiren, ambrisentan, colchicine, dabigatran etexilate, digoxin, everolimus, fexofenadine, imatinib, lapatinib, maraviroc, nilotinib, posaconazole, ranolazine, saxagliptin, sirolimus, sitagliptin, talinolol, tolvaptan, topotecan, bile acid sequestrants"

7.1 Fluvoxamine

Concomitant use of fluvoxamine and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with fluvoxamine resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment. [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.2 Ciprofloxacin

Concomitant use of ciprofoxacin and tizanidine is contraindicated. Changes in pharmacokinetics of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin resulted in significantly decreased blood pressure, increased drowsiness, and increased psychomotor impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.3 CYP1A2 Inhibitors other than Fluvoxamine and Ciprofloxacin

Because of potential drug interactions, concomitant use of tizanidine with other CYP1A2 inhibitors, such as zileuton, fluoroquinolones other than strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (which are contraindicated), antiarrythmics (amiodarone, mexiletine, propafenone, and verapamil), cimetidine, famotidine, oral contraceptives, acyclovir, and ticlopidine) should be avoided. If their use is clinically necessary, therapy should be initiated with 2 mg dose and increased in 2–4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.4 Oral Contraceptives

Concomitant use of tizanidine with oral contraceptives is not recommended. However, if concomitant use is clinically necessary, initiate tizanidine with a single 2 mg dose and increase in 2–4 mg steps daily based on patient response to therapy. If adverse reactions such as hypotension, bradycardia, or excessive drowsiness occur, reduce or discontinue tizanidine therapy. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.5 Alcohol

Alcohol increases the overall amount of drug in the bloodstream after a dose of tizanidine. This was associated with an increase in adverse reactions of tizanidine. The CNS depressant effects of tizanidine and alcohol are additive. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.6 Other CNS Depressants

The sedative effects of tizanidine with CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants) may be additive. Monitor patients who take tizanidine with another CNS depressant for symptoms of excess sedation. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]








7.7 a2-adrenergic agonists

7.1 Propranolol


The dose of rizatriptan benzoate should be adjusted in propranolol-treated patients, as propranolol has been shown to increase the plasma AUC of rizatriptan by 70% [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Ergot-Containing Drugs


Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine-containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and rizatriptan benzoate within 24 hours is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].








7.3 Other 5-HT1 Agonists


Because their vasospastic effects may be additive, co-administration of rizatriptan benzoate and other 5-HT1 agonists within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].








7.4 SSRIs/SNRIs and Serotonin Syndrome


Cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].








7.5 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors


Rizatriptan benzoate is contraindicated in patients taking MAO-A inhibitors and non-selective MAO inhibitors.

Drugs that May Increase the Risk of Hypercalcemia





Clinical Impact


Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or other vitamin D compounds may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. Thiazide diuretics are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine.




Examples


Calcium-containing products, other vitamin D compounds or thiazide diuretics




Intervention


Monitor serum calcium concentrations more frequently and adjust doxercalciferol dose as needed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].





Digitalis Compounds





Clinical Impact


Doxercalciferol can cause hypercalcemia which can potentiate the risk of digitalis toxicity.




Intervention


Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of digitalis toxicity and increase frequency of serum calcium monitoring when initiating or adjusting the dose of doxercalciferol in patients receiving digitalis compounds [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].





Cytochrome P450 Inhibitors





Clinical Impact


Doxercalciferol is activated by CYP 27 in the liver. Cytochrome P450 inhibitors may inhibit the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol and thus reduce the formation of active doxercalciferol moiety [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Examples


Ketoconazole and erythromycin




Intervention


If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a cytochrome P450 inhibitor, dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely.




Enzyme Inducers





Clinical Impact


Doxercalciferol is activated by CYP 27 in the liver. Enzyme inducers may affect the 25-hydroxylation of doxercalciferol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Examples


Glutethimide and phenobarbital




Intervention


If a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with an enzyme inducer, dose adjustment of doxercalciferol may be necessary. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely.




Magnesium-containing Products





Clinical Impact


Concomitant administration of doxercalciferol and high doses of magnesium-containing products may increase the risk of hypermagnesemia.




Examples


Magnesium-containing products such as antacids




Intervention


Avoid use of magnesium-containing products and doxercalciferol in patients on chronic renal dialysis.











Cytochrome P450 inhibitors: Formation of the active doxercalciferol moiety may be hindered and may necessitate dosage adjustment. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. (7)

Enzyme inducers: Formation of the active doxercalciferol moiety may be affected and may necessitate dosage adjustment. Monitor intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations closely. (7)

Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with meperidine hydrochloride tablets.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Meperidine Hydrochloride Tablets





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)




Clinical Impact:

Meperidine is contraindicated in patients who are receiving monoamine oxidase (MAOIs) or those who have recently received such agents. Therapeutic doses of meperidine have occasionally precipitated unpredictable, severe, and occasionally fatal reactions in patients who have received such agents within 14 days. The mechanism of these reactions is unclear, but may be related to a preexisting hyperphenylalaninemia. Some have been characterized by coma, severe respiratory depression, cyanosis, and hypotension, and have resembled the syndrome of acute narcotic overdose. Serotonin syndrome with agitation, hyperthermia, diarrhea, tachycardia, sweating, tremors and impaired consciousness may also occur. In other reactions the predominant manifestations have been hyperexcitability, convulsions, tachycardia, hyperpyrexia, and hypertension.



Intervention:

Do not use meperidine hydrochloride tablets in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.Intravenous hydrocortisone or prednisolone have been used to treat severe reactions, with the addition of intravenous chlorpromazine in those cases exhibiting hypertension and hyperpyrexia. The usefulness and safety of narcotic antagonists in the treatment of these reactions is unknown.)



Examples:

phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid



Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2B6




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of meperidine hydrochloride tablets and CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of meperidine, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of meperidine hydrochloride tablets and CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of meperidine hydrochloride tablets is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].After stopping a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the meperidine plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to meperidine.



Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of meperidine hydrochloride tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients at frequent intervals for respiratory depression and sedation.If a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the meperidine hydrochloride tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal.



Examples:

Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents(e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)



CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of meperidine hydrochloride tablets and CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of meperidine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to meperidine [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].After stopping a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the meperidine plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the meperidine hydrochloride tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.  Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued, consider meperidine hydrochloride tablets dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.



Examples:

Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin



Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants




Clinical Impact:

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.



Intervention:

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3, 5.4)].



Examples:

Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol



Serotonergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].




Intervention:

If concomitant use is warranted,  frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue meperidine hydrochloride tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



Examples:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics




Clinical Impact:

May reduce the analgesic effect of meperidine hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use.



Examples:

butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine



Muscle Relaxants




Clinical Impact:

Meperidine may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.



Intervention:

Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, evaluate patients for signs of respiratory depression, decrease the dosage of meperidine hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].




Diuretics




Clinical Impact:

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



Anticholinergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when meperidine hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.



Acyclovir




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of acyclovir may increase the plasma concentrations of meperidine and its metabolite, normeperidine.



Intervention:

If concomitant use of acyclovir and meperidine hydrochloride tablets is necessary, evaluate patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.



Cimetidine




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of cimetidine may reduce the clearance and volume of distribution of meperidine also the formation of the metabolite, normeperidine, in healthy subjects.



Intervention:

If concomitant use cimetidine and meperidine hydrochloride tablets is necessary, evaluate patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.










Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with meperidine hydrochloride tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of meperidine hydrochloride tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

Inhibitors of CYP3A4




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of fentanyl, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of fentanyl buccal tablet is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to fentanyl.



Intervention:

The concomitant use of fentanyl buccal tablet and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of fentanyl [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to fentanyl [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the fentanyl plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the fentanyl buccal tablet dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider fentanyl buccal tablet dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.



Examples:

Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin



Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants




Clinical Impact:

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.



Intervention:

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction and educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation). If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4)].



Examples:

Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.



Serotonergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)].



Intervention:

If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue fentanyl buccal tablets if serotonin syndrome is suspected.



Examples:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)




Clinical Impact:

MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Intervention:

The use of fentanyl buccal tablets is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.



Examples:

Phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid



Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics




Clinical Impact:

May reduce the analgesic effect of fentanyl buccal tablet and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.



Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use.



Examples:

Butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine



Muscle Relaxants




Clinical Impact:

Fentanyl may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.



Intervention:

Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the dosage of fentanyl buccal tablet and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4)].




Examples:

Cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone



Diuretics




Clinical Impact:

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.



Anticholinergic Drugs




Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.



Intervention:

Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when fentanyl buccal tablet is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.










Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with fentanyl buccal tablet because they may reduce analgesic effect of fentanyl buccal tablet or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.

7.1 General Information

Drugs may interact with warfarin sodium through pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic mechanisms. Pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are synergism (impaired hemostasis, reduced clotting factor synthesis), competitive antagonism (vitamin K), and alteration of the physiologic control loop for vitamin K metabolism (hereditary resistance). Pharmacokinetic mechanisms for drug interactions with warfarin sodium are mainly enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition, and reduced plasma protein binding. It is important to note that some drugs may interact by more than one mechanism. 
More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping other drugs, including botanicals, or when changing dosages of other drugs, including drugs intended for short-term use (e.g., antibiotics, antifungals, corticosteroids) [
         
 
  see Boxed Warning]. 
        

 
Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about interactions with warfarin sodium or adverse reactions pertaining to bleeding.








7.2 CYP450 Interactions

CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. The more potent warfarin 
         
 
  S-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP2C9 while the 
         
 
  R-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2 and 3A4. 
        

 

Inhibitors of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to increase the effect (increase INR) of warfarin by increasing the exposure of warfarin. 
Inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 have the potential to decrease the effect (decrease INR) of warfarin by decreasing the exposure of warfarin. 

Examples of inhibitors and inducers of CYP2C9, 1A2, and 3A4 are below in 
         
 
  Table 2; however, this list should not be considered all-inclusive. Consult the labeling of all concurrently used drugs to obtain further information about CYP450 interaction potential. The CYP450 inhibition and induction potential should be considered when starting, stopping, or changing dose of concomitant medications. Closely monitor INR if a concomitant drug is a CYP2C9, 1A2, and/or 3A4 inhibitor or inducer.

7.4 Antibiotics and Antifungals

There have been reports of changes in INR in patients taking warfarin and antibiotics or antifungals, but clinical pharmacokinetic studies have not shown consistent effects of these agents on plasma concentrations of warfarin. 
Closely monitor INR when starting or stopping any antibiotic or antifungal in patients taking warfarin. 








7.5 Botanical (Herbal) Products and Foods

More frequent INR monitoring should be performed when starting or stopping botanicals.
Few adequate, well-controlled studies evaluating the potential for metabolic and/or pharmacologic interactions between botanicals and warfarin sodium exist. Due to a lack of manufacturing standardization with botanical medicinal preparations, the amount of active ingredients may vary. This could further confound the ability to assess potential interactions and effects on anticoagulation. 
Some botanicals may cause bleeding events when taken alone (e.g., garlic and Ginkgo biloba) and may have anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and/or fibrinolytic properties. These effects would be expected to be additive to the anticoagulant effects of warfarin sodium. Conversely, some botanicals may decrease the effects of warfarin sodium (e.g., co-enzyme Q
         
 
  10, St. John’s wort, ginseng). Some botanicals and foods can interact with warfarin sodium through CYP450 interactions (e.g., echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort). 
        

 
The amount of vitamin K in food may affect therapy with warfarin sodium. Advise patients taking warfarin sodium to eat a normal, balanced diet maintaining a consistent amount of vitamin K. Patients taking warfarin sodium should avoid drastic changes in dietary habits, such as eating large amounts of green leafy vegetables.","amiodarone, capecitabine, cotrimoxazole, etravirine, fluconazole, fluvastatin, fluvoxamine, metronidazole, miconazole, oxandrolone, sulfinpyrazone, tigecycline, voriconazole, zafirlukast, aprepitant, bosentan, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, rifampin, acyclovir, allopurinol, caffeine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, disulfiram, enoxacin, famotidine, fluvoxamine, methoxsalen, mexiletine, norfloxacin, oral contraceptives, phenylpropanolamine, propafenone, propranolol, terbinafine, thiabendazole, ticlopidine, verapamil, zileuton, montelukast, moricizine, omeprazole, phenobarbital, phenytoin, cigarette smoking, alprazolam, amiodarone, amlodipine, amprenavir, aprepitant, atorvastatin, atazanavir, bicalutamide, cilostazol, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, clarithromycin, conivaptan, cyclosporine, darunavir/ritonavir, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, fosamprenavir, imatinib, indinavir, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, nilotinib, oral contraceptives, posaconazole, ranitidine, ranolazine, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, tipranavir, voriconazole, zileuton, armodafinil, amprenavir, aprepitant, bosentan, carbamazepine, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, nafcillin, phenytoin, pioglitazone, prednisone, rifampin, rufinamide, argatroban, dabigatran, bivalirudin, desirudin, heparin, lepirudin, aspirin, cilostazol, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, prasugrel, ticlopidine, celecoxib, diclofenac, diflunisal, fenoprofen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, ketorolac, mefenamic acid, naproxen, oxaprozin, piroxicam, sulindac, citalopram, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, milnacipran, paroxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, vilazodone, garlic, Ginkgo biloba, co-enzyme Q10, St. John’s wort, ginseng, echinacea, grapefruit juice, ginkgo, goldenseal, St. John’s wort"

Table 2 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Indomethacin





Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis







Clinical Impact:




Indomethacin and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of indomethacin and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
           
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.
           






Intervention:



Monitor patients with concomitant use of indomethacin capsules with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.12)
           
     
      ].
          
    
     





Aspirin






Clinical Impact:



Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.2)
           
     
      ].
          
    
     





Intervention:



Concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.12)]
           
     
      .
          
    
     
Indomethacin capsules are not substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.





ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical Impact:




NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).
           
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.
           






Intervention:




During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
           
During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [
            
      
       see Warnings and Precautions (
             
       
        5.6)
            
      
       ]
            
      
       .

When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.
           






Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.
It has been reported that the addition of triamterene to a maintenance schedule of indomethacin capsules resulted in reversible acute renal failure in two of four healthy volunteers. Indomethacin capsules and triamterene should not be administered together.
Both indomethacin capsules and potassium-sparing diuretics may be associated with increased serum potassium levels. The potential effects of indomethacin capsules and potassium-sparing diuretics on potassium levels and renal function should be considered when these agents are administered concurrently.





Intervention:



Indomethacin and triamterene should not be administered together. During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects.
Be aware that indomethacin and potassium-sparing diuretics may both be associated with increased serum potassium levels [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.6)
           
     
      ].
          
    
     





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of indomethacin with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical Impact:



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance
           
     
      . The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.
          
    
     





Intervention:



During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of indomethacin with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [
           
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
            
      
       5.2)
           
     
      ]
           
     
      .

Combined use with diflunisal may be particularly hazardous because diflunisal causes significantly higher plasma levels of indomethacin [
           
     
      see Clinical Pharmacology (
            
      
       12.3)
           
     
      ]. In some patients, combined use of indomethacin and diflunisal has been associated with fatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
          
    
     





Intervention:



The concomitant use of indomethacin with other NSAIDs or salicylates, especially diflunisal, is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.
NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.





Probenecid






Clinical Impact:



When indomethacin is given to patients receiving probenecid, the plasma levels of indomethacin are likely to be increased.





Intervention:



During the concomitant use of indomethacin capsules and probenecid, a lower total daily dosage of indomethacin may produce a satisfactory therapeutic effect. When increases in the dose of indomethacin are made, they should be made carefully and in small increments.











Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking indomethacin capsules with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of indomethacin and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended. (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB), or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with indomethacin may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure. (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with indomethacin in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function. (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects. (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    

Digoxin: Concomitant use with indomethacin can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin. Monitor serum digoxin levels. (
          
  
     7)
         
 
    










Effects on Laboratory Tests

Indomethacin capsules reduces basal plasma renin activity (PRA), as well as those elevations of PRA induced by furosemide administration, or salt or volume depletion. These facts should be considered when evaluating plasma renin activity in hypertensive patients.
False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients being treated with indomethacin have been reported. Thus, results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients.","warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs, SNRIs, propranolol, furosemide, triamterene, digoxin, lithium, methotrexate, cyclosporine, diflunisal, salsalate, pemetrexed, diclofenac, meloxicam, nabumetone, probenecid"

Strong-moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil) and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may affect everolimus concentrations (7.1). Consider everolimus dose adjustment. (5.14)
Therapeutic drug monitoring and dose reduction for everolimus should be considered when everolimus is coadministered with cannabidiol (5.22, 7.13).







7.1 Interactions with Strong Inhibitors or Inducers of CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein

Everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver and to some extent in the intestinal wall and is a substrate for the multidrug efflux pump, P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, absorption and subsequent elimination of systemically absorbed everolimus may be influenced by medicinal products that affect CYP3A4 and/or P-gp. Concurrent treatment with strong inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) and inducers (e.g., rifampin, rifabutin) of CYP3A4 is not recommended. Inhibitors of P-gp (e.g., digoxin, cyclosporine) may decrease the efflux of everolimus from intestinal cells and increase everolimus blood concentrations. In vitro, everolimus was a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of CYP2D6, potentially increasing the concentrations of medicinal products eliminated by these enzymes. Thus, caution should be exercised when coadministering everolimus with CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].
All in vivo interaction studies were conducted without concomitant cyclosporine. Pharmacokinetic interactions between everolimus and concomitantly administered drugs are discussed below. Drug interaction studies have not been conducted with drugs other than those described below.








7.2 Cyclosporine (CYP3A4/P-gp Inhibitor and CYP3A4 Substrate)

The steady-state Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) estimates of everolimus were significantly increased by coadministration of single dose cyclosporine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Dose adjustment of everolimus might be needed if the cyclosporine dose is altered [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Everolimus had a clinically minor influence on cyclosporine pharmacokinetics in transplant patients receiving cyclosporine (Neoral).








7.3 Ketoconazole and Other Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Multiple-dose ketoconazole administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus Cmax, AUC, and half-life. It is recommended that strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) should not be co-administered with everolimus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.4 Erythromycin (Moderate CYP3A4 Inhibitor)

Multiple-dose erythromycin administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus Cmax, AUC, and half-life. If erythromycin is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.5 Verapamil (CYP3A4 and P-gp Substrate) 

Multiple-dose verapamil administration to healthy volunteers significantly increased single dose estimates of everolimus Cmax and AUC. Everolimus half-life was not changed. If verapamil is coadministered, everolimus blood concentrations should be monitored and a dose adjustment made as necessary [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.6 Atorvastatin (CYP3A4 substrate) and Pravastatin (P-gp substrate) 

Single-dose administration of everolimus with either atorvastatin or pravastatin to healthy subjects did not influence the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, pravastatin and everolimus, as well as total HMG-CoA reductase bioreactivity in plasma to a clinically relevant extent. However, these results cannot be extrapolated to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Patients should be monitored for the development of rhabdomyolysis and other adverse reactions as described in the respective labeling for these products.








7.7 Simvastatin and Lovastatin

Due to an interaction with cyclosporine, clinical studies of everolimus with cyclosporine conducted in kidney transplant patients strongly discouraged patients with receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin and lovastatin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)].








7.8 Rifampin (Strong CYP3A4/P-gp Inducers) 

Pretreatment of healthy subjects with multiple-dose rifampin followed by a single dose of everolimus increased everolimus clearance and decreased the everolimus Cmax and AUC estimates. Combination with rifampin is not recommended [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.9 Midazolam (CYP3A4/5 substrate) 

Single-dose administration of midazolam to healthy volunteers following administration of multiple-dose everolimus indicated that everolimus is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. Dose adjustment of midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with midazolam or other CYP3A4/5 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.10 Other Possible Interactions

Moderate inhibitors of CYP3A4 and P-gp may increase everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., fluconazole; macrolide antibiotics; nicardipine, diltiazem; nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir). Inducers of CYP3A4 may increase the metabolism of everolimus and decrease everolimus blood concentrations (e.g., St. John's Wort [Hypericum perforatum]; anticonvulsants: carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin; efavirenz, nevirapine).








7.11 Octreotide

Coadministration of everolimus and depot octreotide increased octreotide Cmin by approximately 50%.








7.12 Tacrolimus

There is little to no pharmacokinetic interaction of tacrolimus on everolimus, and consequently, dose adjustment of everolimus is not necessary when everolimus is coadministered with tacrolimus.








7.13 Cannabidiol

The blood levels of everolimus may increase upon concomitant use with cannabidiol. When cannabidiol and everolimus are co-administered, closely monitor for an increase in everolimus blood levels and for adverse reactions suggestive of everolimus toxicity. A dose reduction of everolimus should be considered as needed when everolimus is co-administered with cannabidiol [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.22)].","cyclosporine, ketoconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, rifampin, cannabidiol, itraconazole, voriconazole, clarithromycin, telithromycin, ritonavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, rifabutin, digoxin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, midazolam, fluconazole, nicardipine, diltiazem, nelfinavir, indinavir, amprenavir, St. John's Wort, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, efavirenz, nevirapine, octreotide, tacrolimus"

CYP3A4 Inhibitors


Felodipine is metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, cimetidine) with felodipine may lead to several-fold increases in the plasma levels of felodipine, either due to an increase in bioavailability or due to a decrease in metabolism. These increases in concentration may lead to increased effects, (lower blood pressure and increased heart rate). These effects have been observed with co-administration of itraconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor). Caution should be used when CYP3A4 inhibitors are co-administered with felodipine. A conservative approach to dosing felodipine should be taken. The following specific interactions have been reported:

Itraconazole 

Co-administration of another extended-release formulation of felodipine with itraconazole resulted in approximately 8-fold increase in the AUC, more than 6-fold increase in the Cmax, and 2-fold prolongation in the half-life of felodipine.

Erythromycin 

Co-administration of felodipine extended-release tablets erythromycin resulted in approximately 2.5-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, and about 2-fold prolongation in the half-life of felodipine.

Grapefruit Juice 

Co-administration of felodipine with grapefruit juice resulted in more than 2-fold increase in the AUC and Cmax, but no prolongation in the half-life of felodipine.

Cimetidine 

Co-administration of felodipine with cimetidine (a non-specific CYP-450 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the AUC and the Cmax, of felodipine.


Beta-Blocking Agents


A pharmacokinetic study of felodipine in conjunction with metoprolol demonstrated no significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of felodipine. The AUC and Cmax of metoprolol, however, were increased approximately 31 and 38%, respectively. In controlled clinical trials, however, beta blockers including metoprolol were concurrently administered with felodipine and were well tolerated.


Digoxin 


When given concomitantly with felodipine extended-release tablets the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in patients with heart failure were not significantly altered.


Anticonvulsants 


In a pharmacokinetic study, maximum plasma concentrations of felodipine were considerably lower in epileptic patients on long-term anticonvulsant therapy (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, or phenobarbital) than in healthy volunteers. In such patients, the mean area under the felodipine plasma concentration-time curve was also reduced to approximately 6% of that observed in healthy volunteers. Since a clinically significant interaction may be anticipated, alternative antihypertensive therapy should be considered in these patients.


Tacrolimus 


Felodipine may increase the blood concentration of tacrolimus. When given concomitantly with felodipine, the tacrolimus blood concentration should be followed and the tacrolimus dose may need to be adjusted.


Other Concomitant Therapy


In healthy subjects there were no clinically significant interactions when felodipine was given concomitantly with indomethacin or spironolactone.

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on KRAZATI







Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with strong CYP3A inducers.
Adagrasib is a CYP3A4 substrate. Concomitant use of KRAZATI with a strong CYP3A inducer reduces adagrasib exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may reduce the effectiveness of KRAZATI.










Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with strong CYP3A inhibitors until adagrasib concentrations have reached steady state (after approximately 8 days).
Adagrasib is a CYP3A4 substrate. If adagrasib concentrations have not reached steady state, concomitant use of a strong CYP3A inhibitor will increase adagrasib concentrations, [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of KRAZATI adverse reactions.










7.2 Effects of KRAZATI on Other Drugs







Sensitive CYP3A Substrates

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP3A substrates unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP3A inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of CYP3A substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.










Sensitive CYP2C9 Substrates

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP2C9 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of CYP2C9 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.










Sensitive CYP2D6 Substrates

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.










P-gp Substrates

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with P-gp substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions unless otherwise recommended in the Prescribing Information for these substrates.
Adagrasib is a P-gp inhibitor. Concomitant use with KRAZATI increases exposure of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.










7.3 Drugs That Prolong QTc Interval

Avoid concomitant use of KRAZATI with other product(s) with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor electrocardiogram and electrolytes prior to starting KRAZATI, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Withhold KRAZATI if the QTc interval is > 500 ms or the change from baseline is > 60 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Adagrasib causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Concomitant use of KRAZATI with other products that prolong the QTc interval may result in a greater increase in the QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including Torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].","Strong CYP3A4 Inducers,Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors,Sensitive CYP3A4 Substrates,Sensitive CYP2C9 Substrates,Sensitive CYP2D6 Substrates,P-gp Substrates"

Topiramate

Some patients may experience a large increase in amitriptyline concentration in the presence of topiramate and any adjustments in amitriptyline dose should be made according to the patient's clinical response and not on the basis of plasma levels.

Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6

The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7 to 10% of Caucasians are so called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).
In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

When amitriptyline is given with anticholinergic agents or sympathomimetic drugs, including epinephrine combined with local anesthetics, close supervision and careful adjustment of dosages are required.
Hyperpyrexia has been reported when amitriptyline is administered with anticholinergic agents or with neuroleptic drugs, particularly during hot weather.
Paralytic ileus may occur in patients taking tricyclic antidepressants in combination with anticholinergic-type drugs.
Cimetidine is reported to reduce hepatic metabolism of certain tricyclic antidepressants, thereby delaying elimination and increasing steady-state concentrations of these drugs. Clinically significant effects have been reported with the tricyclic antidepressants when used concomitantly with cimetidine. Increases in plasma levels of tricyclic antidepressants, and in the frequency and severity of side effects, particularly anticholinergic, have been reported when cimetidine was added to the drug regimen. Discontinuation of cimetidine in well-controlled patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants and cimetidine may decrease the plasma levels and efficacy of the antidepressants.
Caution is advised if patients receive large doses of ethchlorvynol concurrently. Transient delirium has been reported in patients who were treated with one gram of ethchlorvynol and 75 to 150 mg of amitriptyline hydrochloride.","Topiramate, quinidine, cimetidine, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, guanethidine, thyroid medication, alcohol, barbiturates, CNS depressants, disulfiram, anticholinergic agents, sympathomimetic drugs, epinephrine, neuroleptic drugs, ethchlorvynol"

7.1 Nitrates

Administration of nitrates within 48 hours after the last dose of ALYQ™ is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1)].








7.2 Alpha-Blockers

PDE5 inhibitors, including ALYQ™, and alpha–adrenergic blocking agents are both vasodilators with blood-pressure-lowering effects. When vasodilators are used in combination, an additive effect on blood pressure may be anticipated. Clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted with coadministration of tadalafil with doxazosin, alfuzosin or tamsulosin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].








7.3 Antihypertensives

PDE5 inhibitors, including ALYQ™, are mild systemic vasodilators. Clinical pharmacology studies were conducted to assess the effect of tadalafil on the potentiation of the blood–pressure–lowering effects of selected antihypertensive medications (amlodipine, angiotensin II receptor blockers, bendroflumethiazide, enalapril, and metoprolol). Small reductions in blood pressure occurred following coadministration of tadalafil with these agents compared with placebo [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].








7.4 Alcohol

Both alcohol and tadalafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, act as mild vasodilators. When mild vasodilators are taken in combination, blood pressure–lowering effects of each individual compound may be increased. Substantial consumption of alcohol (e.g., 5 units or greater) in combination with ALYQ™ can increase the potential for orthostatic signs and symptoms, including increase in heart rate, decrease in standing blood pressure, dizziness, and headache. Tadalafil (10 mg or 20 mg) did not affect alcohol plasma concentrations and alcohol did not affect tadalafil plasma concentrations. [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].









7.5 CYP3A Inhibitors/Inducers


Ritonavir

Ritonavir initially inhibits and later induces CYP3A, the enzyme involved in the metabolism of tadalafil. At steady state of ritonavir (about 1 week), the exposure to tadalafil is similar as in the absence of ritonavir [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) 
and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Potent Inhibitors of CYP3A


Tadalafil is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A in the liver. In patients taking potent inhibitors of CYP3A such as ketoconazole, and itraconazole, avoid use of ALYQ™ [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors   

In healthy adult subjects, concomitant administration of daptomycin for injection and simvastatin had no effect on plasma trough concentrations of simvastatin, and there were no reports of skeletal myopathy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

However, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase may cause myopathy, which is manifested as muscle pain or weakness associated with elevated levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). In the adult Phase 3 S. aureus bacteremia/endocarditis trial, some patients who received prior or concomitant treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor developed elevated CPK [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Experience with the coadministration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and daptomycin for injection in patients is limited; therefore, consideration should be given to suspending use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors temporarily in patients receiving Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection.








7.2 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions   

Clinically relevant plasma concentrations of daptomycin have been observed to cause a significant concentration-dependent false prolongation of prothrombin time (PT) and elevation of International Normalized Ratio (INR) when certain recombinant thromboplastin reagents are utilized for the assay. The possibility of an erroneously elevated PT/INR result due to interaction with a recombinant thromboplastin reagent may be minimized by drawing specimens for PT or INR testing near the time of trough plasma concentrations of daptomycin. However, sufficient daptomycin concentrations may be present at trough to cause interaction.
If confronted with an abnormally high PT/INR result in a patient being treated with Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection, it is recommended that clinicians:


1.Repeat the assessment of PT/INR, requesting that the specimen be drawn just prior to the next Daptomycin in Sodium Chloride Injection dose (i.e., at trough concentration). If the PT/INR value obtained at trough remains substantially elevated above what would otherwise be expected, consider evaluating PT/INR utilizing an alternative method.

2.Evaluate for other causes of abnormally elevated PT/INR results.",simvastatin

Administration of reserpine during therapy with a tricyclic antidepressant has been shown to produce a ""stimulating"" effect in some depressed patients.
Close supervision and careful adjustment of the dosage are required when nortriptyline hydrochloride is used with other anticholinergic drugs and sympathomimetic drugs.
Concurrent administration of cimetidine and tricyclic antidepressants can produce clinically significant increases in the plasma concentrations of the tricyclic antidepressant. The patient should be informed that the response to alcohol may be exaggerated.
A case of significant hypoglycemia has been reported in a type II diabetic patient maintained on chlorpropamide (250 mg/day), after the addition of nortriptyline (125 mg/day).






Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6

The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so called ""poor metabolizers""); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).
In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be coadministered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

7.1 Cytochrome P450 Substrates

Cytochrome P450s in the liver are down regulated by infection and inflammation stimuli including cytokines such as IL-6. Inhibition of IL-6 signaling in patients treated with SYLVANT may restore CYP450 activities to higher levels leading to increased metabolism of drugs that are CYP450 substrates compared to metabolism prior to treatment with SYLVANT.
Upon initiation or discontinuation of SYLVANT, in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, perform therapeutic monitoring of effect (e.g., warfarin) or drug concentration (e.g., cyclosporine or theophylline) as needed and adjust dose. The effect of SYLVANT on CYP450 enzyme activity can persist for several weeks after stopping therapy.

7.1 Estrogens and Estrogen Agonist/Antagonist

Do not use OSPHENA concomitantly with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists. The safety of concomitant use of OSPHENA with estrogens and estrogen agonists/antagonists has not been studied.








7.2 Fluconazole

Fluconazole, a moderate CYP3A / strong CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inhibitor, should not be used with OSPHENA. Fluconazole increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 2.7-fold. Administration of fluconazole with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 Rifampin

Rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 / moderate CYP2C9 / moderate CYP2C19 inducer, decreases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 58%. Therefore, co-administration of OSPHENA with drugs such as rifampin which induce CYP3A4, CYP2C9 and/or CYP2C19 activity would be expected to decrease the systemic exposure of ospemifene, which may decrease the clinical effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.4 Ketoconazole

Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases the systemic exposure of ospemifene by 1.4-fold. Administration of ketoconazole chronically with ospemifene may increase the risk of OSPHENA-related adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.5 Warfarin

Repeated administration of ospemifene had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 10 mg dose of warfarin. No study was conducted with multiple doses of warfarin. The effect of ospemifene on clotting time such as the International Normalized Ratio (INR) or prothrombin time (PT) was not studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.6 Highly Protein-Bound Drugs

Ospemifene is more than 99% bound to serum proteins and might affect the protein binding of other drugs. Use of OSPHENA with other drug products that are highly protein-bound may lead to increased exposure of either that drug or ospemifene [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The administration of local anesthetic solutions containing vasopressors, such as Levonordefrin, Epinephrine or Norepinephrine, to patients receiving tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors may produce severe, prolonged hypertension. Concurrent use of these agents should generally be avoided. In situations when concurrent therapy is necessary, careful patient monitoring is essential. Concurrent administration of vasopressor drugs and of ergot-type oxytocic drugs may cause severe, persistent hypertension or cerebrovascular accidents.
Phenothiazines and butyrophenones may reduce or reverse the pressor effect of Epinephrine.
Solutions containing a vasoconstrictor should be used cautiously in the presence of disease which may adversely affect the patient's cardiovascular system. Serious cardiac arrhythmias may occur if preparations containing a vasoconstrictor are employed in patients during or following the administration of potent inhalation anesthetics.

CLARITHROMYCIN tablets, for oral use
 
Initial U.S. Approval: 1991",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Co-administration of clarithromycin tablets is known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolized by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug.
Clarithromycin tablets should be used with caution in patients receiving treatment with other drugs known to be CYP3A enzyme substrates, especially if the CYP3A substrate has a narrow safety margin (e.g., carbamazepine) and/or the substrate is extensively metabolized by this enzyme. Adjust dosage when appropriate and monitor serum concentrations of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A closely in patients concurrently receiving clarithromycin.

)].
    
     
Serum concentrations of these medications should also be monitored. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with disopyramide and quinidine.
There have been postmarketing reports of hypoglycemia with the concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide. Therefore, blood glucose levels should be monitored during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and disopyramide.




Digoxin


Use With Caution



Digoxin:Digoxin is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and clarithromycin is known to inhibit Pgp. When clarithromycin and digoxin are co‑administered, inhibition of Pgp by clarithromycin may lead to increased exposure of digoxin. Elevated digoxin serum concentrations in patients receiving clarithromycin and digoxin concomitantly have been reported in postmarketing surveillance. Some patients have shown clinical signs consistent with digoxin toxicity, including potentially fatal arrhythmias. Monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations should be considered, especially for patients with digoxin concentrations in the upper therapeutic range.
    
     




Oral Anticoagulants:






Warfarin


Use With Caution



Oral anticoagulants:Spontaneous reports in the postmarketing period suggest that concomitant administration of clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants may potentiate the effects of the oral anticoagulants. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving clarithromycin and oral anticoagulants simultaneously
     
      [see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5.4)]
     
      .
    
     




Antiepileptics:






Carbamazepine


Use With Caution



Carbamazepine:Concomitant administration of single doses of clarithromycin and carbamazepine has been shown to result in increased plasma concentrations of carbamazepine. Blood level monitoring of carbamazepine may be considered. Increased serum concentrations of carbamazepine were observed in clinical trials with clarithromycin. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with carbamazepine.
    
     




Antifungals:






Itraconazole


Use With Caution



Itraconazole:Both clarithromycin and itraconazole are substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A, potentially leading to a bi-directional drug interaction when administered concomitantly (see also Itraconazole under “Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets” in the table below). Clarithromycin may increase the plasma concentrations of itraconazole. Patients taking itraconazole and clarithromycin concomitantly should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged adverse reactions.

       4.7)]
     
      





Antispasmodics:






Tolterodine (patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity)


Use With Caution



Tolterodine:The primary route of metabolism for tolterodine is via CYP2D6. However, in a subset of the population devoid of CYP2D6, the identified pathway of metabolism is via CYP3A. In this population subset, inhibition of CYP3A results in significantly higher serum concentrations of tolterodine. Tolterodine 1 mg twice daily is recommended in patients deficient in CYP2D6 activity (poor metabolizers) when co-administered with clarithromycin.
    
     




Antivirals:

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors:






Sildenafil
Tadalafil
Vardenafil


Use With Caution



Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Vardenafil:Each of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors is primarily metabolized by CYP3A, and CYP3A will be inhibited by concomitant administration of clarithromycin. Co-administration of clarithromycin with sildenafil, tadalafil, or vardenafil will result in increased exposure of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Co-administration of these phosphodiesterase inhibitors with clarithromycin is not recommended. Increased systemic exposure of these drugs may occur with clarithromycin; reduction of dosage for phosphodiesterase inhibitors should be considered (see their respective prescribing information).
    
     




Proton Pump Inhibitors:






Omeprazole


No Dose Adjustment



Omeprazole:The mean 24-hour gastric pH value was 5.2 when omeprazole was administered alone and 5.7 when coadministered with clarithromycin as a result of increased omeprazole exposures
     
      [see Pharmacokinetics (
      
       12.3)]
     
      (see also Omeprazole under “Drugs That Affect Clarithromycin Tablets” in the table below).
    
     




Xanthine Derivatives:

Alprazolam
Triazolam




Triazolam, Alprazolam:Caution and appropriate dose adjustments should be considered when triazolam or alprazolam is co-administered with clarithromycin. There have been postmarketing reports of drug interactions and central nervous system (CNS) effects (e.g., somnolence and confusion) with the concomitant use of clarithromycin and triazolam. Monitoring the patient for increased CNS pharmacological effects is suggested.
    
     
In postmarketing experience, erythromycin has been reported to decrease the clearance of triazolam and midazolam, and thus, may increase the pharmacologic effect of these benzodiazepines.




Temazepam
Nitrazepam
Lorazepam


No Dose Adjustment



Temazepam, Nitrazepam, Lorazepam:For benzodiazepines which are not metabolized by CYP3A (e.g., temazepam, nitrazepam, lorazepam), a clinically important interaction with clarithromycin is unlikely.
    
     




Cytochrome P450 Inducers:

Recommendation




Comments





Antifungals:






Itraconazole


Use With Caution



Itraconazole:Itraconazole may increase the plasma concentrations of clarithromycin.

Antivirals:






Atazanavir


Use With Caution



Atazanavir:When clarithromycin is co-administered with atazanavir, the dose of clarithromycin should be decreased by 50%
     
      [see Clinical Pharmacology (
      
       12.3)]
     
      .
    
     
Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is co‑administered with atazanavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to
     
      Mycobacterium aviumcomplex. Doses of clarithromycin greater than 1000 mg per day should not be co-administered with protease inhibitors.
    
     




Ritonavir (in patients with decreased renal function)




Ritonavir:Since concentrations of 14-OH clarithromycin are significantly reduced when clarithromycin is co-administered with ritonavir, alternative antibacterial therapy should be considered for indications other than infections due to

       12.3)]
     
      .
    
     




Etravirine




Etravirine:Clarithromycin exposure was decreased by etravirine; however, concentrations of the active metabolite, 14-OH-clarithromycin, were increased. Because 14-OH-clarithromycin has reduced activity against
     
      Mycobacterium aviumcomplex (MAC), overall activity against this pathogen may be altered; therefore alternatives to clarithromycin should be considered for the treatment of MAC.

Nevirapine
Rifampicin
Rifabutin
Rifapentine


Use With Caution


Inducers of CYP3A enzymes, such as efavirenz, nevirapine, rifampicin, rifabutin, and rifapentine will increase the metabolism of clarithromycin, thus decreasing plasma concentrations of clarithromycin, while increasing those of 14-OH-clarithromycin. Since the microbiological activities of clarithromycin and 14-OH-clarithromycin are different for different bacteria, the intended therapeutic effect could be impaired during concomitant administration of clarithromycin and enzyme inducers. Alternative antibacterial treatment should be considered when treating patients receiving inducers of CYP3A. There have been spontaneous or published reports of CYP3A based interactions of clarithromycin with rifabutin (see Rifabutin under “Drugs That Are Affected By Clarithromycin Tablets” in the table above).









Co-administration of clarithromycin tablets can alter the concentrations of other drugs. The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (

TERBINAFINE tablets, for oral use
 
Initial U.S. Approval: 1992",DI,"7. DRUG INTERACTIONS




Terbinafine is an inhibitor of CYP450 2D6 isozyme and has an effect on metabolism of desipramine. Drug interactions have also been noted with cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, and caffeine. (
 
    7.1)

   







7.1 Drug-Drug Interactions


In vivostudies have shown that terbinafine is an inhibitor of the CYP450 2D6 isozyme. Drugs predominantly metabolized by the CYP450 2D6 isozyme include the following drug classes: tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics class 1C (e.g., flecainide and propafenone) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors Type B. Coadministration of Terbinafine tablets should be done with careful monitoring and may require a reduction in dose of the 2D6-metabolized drug. In a study to assess the effects of terbinafine on desipramine in healthy volunteers characterized as normal metabolizers, the administration of terbinafine resulted in a 2-fold increase in C
 
  maxand a 5-fold increase in area under the curve (AUC). In this study, these effects were shown to persist at the last observation at 4 weeks after discontinuation of Terbinafine tablets. In studies in healthy subjects characterized as extensive metabolizers of dextromethorphan (antitussive drug and CYP2D6 probe substrate), terbinafine increases the dextromethorphan/ dextrorphan metabolite ratio in urine by 16- to 97-fold on average. Thus, terbinafine may convert extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers to poor metabolizer status.

 

In vitrostudies with human liver microsomes showed that terbinafine does not inhibit the metabolism of tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cyclosporine, cisapride and fluvastatin.
 
  In vivodrug-drug interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. The influence of terbinafine on the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole, cotrimoxazole (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole), zidovudine or theophylline was not considered to be clinically significant.

 
Coadministration of a single dose of fluconazole (100 mg) with a single dose of terbinafine resulted in a 52% and 69% increase in terbinafine C
 
  maxand AUC, respectively. Fluconazole is an inhibitor of CYP2C9 and CYP3A enzymes. Based on this finding, it is likely that other inhibitors of both CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, amiodarone) may also lead to a substantial increase in the systemic exposure (C
 
  maxand AUC) of terbinafine when concomitantly administered.

 
There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between Terbinafine tablets and these changes has not been established.
Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CYP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CYP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, and calcium channel blockers.








7.2 Food Interactions

An evaluation of the effect of food on Terbinafine tablets was conducted. An increase of less than 20% of the AUC of terbinafine was observed when Terbinafine tablets were administered with food. Terbinafine tablets can be taken with or without food.","desipramine, cimetidine, fluconazole, cyclosporine, rifampin, caffeine, flecainide, propafenone, dextromethorphan, tolbutamide, ethinylestradiol, ethoxycoumarin, cisapride, fluvastatin, antipyrine, digoxin, cotrimoxazole, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, zidovudine, theophylline, ketoconazole, amiodarone, warfarin"

Since colestipol hydrochloride is an anion exchange resin, it may have a strong affinity for anions other than the bile acids. 
         
 
  In vitro studies have indicated that colestipol hydrochloride binds a number of drugs. Therefore, colestipol hydrochloride tablets may delay or reduce the absorption of concomitant oral medication. The interval between the administration of colestipol hydrochloride tablets and any other medication should be as long as possible. Patients should take other drugs at least one hour before or four hours after colestipol hydrochloride tablets to avoid impeding their absorption.
        

 
Repeated doses of colestipol hydrochloride given prior to a single-dose of propranolol in human trials have been reported to decrease propranolol absorption. However, in a follow-up study in normal subjects, single-dose administration of colestipol hydrochloride and propranolol and twice-a-day administration for 5 days of both agents did not affect the extent of propranolol absorption, but had a small yet statistically significant effect on its rate of absorption; the time to reach maximum concentration was delayed approximately 30 minutes. Effects on the absorption of other beta-blockers have not been determined. Therefore, patients on propranolol should be observed when colestipol hydrochloride tablets are either added or deleted from a therapeutic regimen.
Studies in humans show that the absorption of chlorothiazide as reflected in urinary excretion is markedly decreased even when administered one hour before colestipol hydrochloride. The absorption of tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, and gemfibrozil was significantly decreased when given simultaneously with colestipol hydrochloride; these drugs were not tested to determine the effect of administration one hour before colestipol hydrochloride.
No depressant effect on blood levels in humans was noted when colestipol hydrochloride was administered with any of the following drugs: aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic acid (niacin), tolbutamide, phenytoin or warfarin. Particular caution should be observed with digitalis preparations since there are conflicting results for the effect of colestipol hydrochloride on the availability of digoxin and digitoxin. The potential for binding of these drugs if given concomitantly is present. Discontinuing colestipol hydrochloride could pose a hazard to health if a potentially toxic drug that is significantly bound to the resin has been titrated to a maintenance level while the patient was taking colestipol hydrochloride.
Bile acid binding resins may also interfere with the absorption of oral phosphate supplements and hydrocortisone.
A study has shown that cholestyramine binds bile acids and reduces mycophenolic acid exposure. As colestipol also binds bile acids, colestipol may reduce mycophenolic acid exposure and potentially reduce efficacy of mycophenolate mofetil.","propranolol, chlorothiazide, tetracycline, furosemide, penicillin G, hydrochlorothiazide, gemfibrozil, aspirin, clindamycin, clofibrate, methyldopa, nicotinic acid, niacin, tolbutamide, phenytoin, warfarin, digoxin, digitoxin, oral phosphate supplements, hydrocortisone, cholestyramine, mycophenolic acid, mycophenolate mofetil"

Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6

:The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the Caucasian population (about 7% to 10% of Caucasians are so-called “poor metabolizers”); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite  large (8-fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).

 
In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of this isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6 (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI-TCA interaction may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the coadministration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.
The plasma concentration of imipramine hydrochloride may increase when the drug is given concomitantly with hepatic enzyme inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, fluoxetine) and decrease by concomitant administration of hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin), and adjustment of the dosage of imipramine hydrochloride may therefore be necessary.
In occasional susceptible patients or in those receiving anticholinergic drugs (including antiparkinsonism agents) in addition, the atropine-like effects may become more pronounced (e.g., paralytic ileus). Close supervision and careful adjustment of dosage is required when imipramine hydrochloride is administered concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.
Avoid the use of preparations, such as decongestants and local anesthetics, that contain any sympathomimetic amine (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine), since it has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the effects of catecholamines.
Caution should be exercised when imipramine hydrochloride is used with agents that lower blood pressure. Imipramine hydrochloride may potentiate the effects of CNS depressant drugs.
Patients should be warned that imipramine hydrochloride may enhance the CNS depressant effects of alcohol. (See

Catecholamine-depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Patients treated with atenolol plus a catecholamine depletor should therefore be closely observed for evidence of hypotension and/or marked bradycardia which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.
Calcium channel blockers may also have an additive effect when given with atenolol (see 

WARNINGS

).
Disopyramide is a Type I antiarrhythmic drug with potent negative inotropic and chronotropic effects. Disopyramide has been associated with severe bradycardia, asystole and heart failure when administered with beta-blockers.
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with beta-blockers.
Beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension which can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If the two drugs are coadministered, the beta-blocker should be withdrawn several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, the introduction of beta-blockers should be delayed for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.
Concomitant use of prostaglandin synthase inhibiting drugs, e.g., indomethacin, may decrease the hypotensive effects of beta-blockers.
Information on concurrent usage of atenolol and aspirin is limited. Data from several studies, i.e., TIMI-II, ISIS-2, currently do not suggest any clinical interaction between aspirin and beta-blockers in the acute myocardial infarction setting.
While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may have a more severe reaction on repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat the allergic reaction.
Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate.

  Potent inhibitors of CYP1A2 should be avoided (
  
     7.1)
 
    
  Potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 may increase duloxetine concentrations (
  
     7.2)
 
    
  Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6 (
  
     7.9)
 
    









Both CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 are responsible for duloxetine metabolism.







7.1 Inhibitors of CYP1A2

When duloxetine 60 mg was co-administered with fluvoxamine 100 mg, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, to male subjects (n=14) duloxetine AUC was increased approximately 6-fold, the C
 
  maxwas increased about 2.5-fold, and duloxetine t
 
  1/2was increased approximately 3-fold. Other drugs that inhibit CYP1A2 metabolism include cimetidine and quinolone antimicrobials such as ciprofloxacin and enoxacin
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.12)]
 
  
.








7.2 Inhibitors of CYP2D6

Concomitant use of duloxetine (40 mg once daily) with paroxetine (20 mg once daily) increased the concentration of duloxetine AUC by about 60%, and greater degrees of inhibition are expected with higher doses of paroxetine. Similar effects would be expected with other potent CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., fluoxetine, quinidine)
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.12)]
 
  
.








7.3 Dual Inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6

Concomitant administration of duloxetine 40 mg twice daily with fluvoxamine 100 mg, a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor, to CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects (n=14) resulted in a 6-fold increase in duloxetine AUC and C
 
  max
.








7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDs, Aspirin, and Warfarin)

Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SSRIs or SNRIs are co-administered with warfarin. Concomitant administration of warfarin (2 to 9 mg once daily) under steady state conditions with duloxetine 60 or 120 mg once daily for up to 14 days in healthy subjects (n=15) did not significantly change INR from baseline (mean INR changes ranged from 0.05 to +0.07). The total warfarin (protein bound plus free drug) pharmacokinetics (AUC
 
  T,ss,C
 
  max,ssor t
 
  max,ss) for both R- and S-warfarin were not altered by duloxetine. Because of the potential effect of duloxetine on platelets, patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when duloxetine is initiated or discontinued
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.5)]
 
  
.








7.5 Lorazepam

Under steady-state conditions for duloxetine (60 mg Q 12 hours) and lorazepam (2 mg Q 12 hours), the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were not affected by co-administration.







7.6 Temazepam

Under steady-state conditions for duloxetine (20 mg qhs) and temazepam (30 mg qhs), the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine were not affected by co-administration.







7.7 Drugs that Affect Gastric Acidity

Duloxetine delayed-release capsules have an enteric coating that resists dissolution until reaching a segment of the gastrointestinal tract where the pH exceeds 5.5. In extremely acidic conditions, duloxetine, unprotected by the enteric coating, may undergo hydrolysis to form naphthol. Caution is advised in using duloxetine in patients with conditions that may slow gastric emptying (e.g., some diabetics). Drugs that raise the gastrointestinal pH may lead to an earlier release of duloxetine. However, co-administration of duloxetine with aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids (51 mEq) or duloxetine with famotidine, had no significant effect on the rate or extent of duloxetine absorption after administration of a 40 mg oral dose. It is unknown whether the concomitant administration of proton pump inhibitors affects duloxetine absorption
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.14)]
 
  
.








7.8 Drugs Metabolized by CYP1A2


In vitrodrug interaction studies demonstrate that duloxetine does not induce CYP1A2 activity. Therefore, an increase in the metabolism of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine) resulting from induction is not anticipated, although clinical studies of induction have not been performed. Duloxetine is an inhibitor of the CYP1A2 isoform in
 
  in vitrostudies, and in two clinical studies the average (90% confidence interval) increase in theophylline AUC was 7% (1% to 15%) and 20% (13% to 27%) when co-administered with duloxetine (60 mg twice daily).

 







7.9 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

Duloxetine is a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. When duloxetine was administered (at a dose of 60 mg twice daily) in conjunction with a single 50 mg dose of desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, the AUC of desipramine increased 3-fold
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (

.








7.10 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C9

Results of
 
  in vitrostudies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit activity. In a clinical study, the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, were not significantly affected by duloxetine
 
  [see Drug Interactions (
  
   7.4)]
 
  
. 

 







7.11 Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A

Results of
 
  in vitrostudies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit or induce CYP3A activity. Therefore, an increase or decrease in the metabolism of CYP3A substrates (e.g., oral contraceptives and other steroidal agents) resulting from induction or inhibition is not anticipated, although clinical studies have not been performed.

 







7.12 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2C19

Results of
 
  in vitrostudies demonstrate that duloxetine does not inhibit CYP2C19 activity at therapeutic concentrations. Inhibition of the metabolism of CYP2C19 substrates is therefore not anticipated, although clinical studies have not been performed.

   2.8,
  
   2.9), Contraindications (4), and Warnings and Precautions (

7.14 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with duloxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider is continuation of duloxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs

When duloxetine and ethanol were administered several hours apart so that peak concentrations of each would coincide, duloxetine did not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by alcohol.
In the duloxetine clinical trials database, three duloxetine -treated patients had liver injury as manifested by ALT and total bilirubin elevations, with evidence of obstruction. Substantial intercurrent ethanol use was present in each of these cases, and this may have contributed to the abnormalities seen

7.17 Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein

Because duloxetine is highly bound to plasma protein, administration of duloxetine to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. However, co-administration of duloxetine (60 or 120 mg) with warfarin (2 to 9 mg), a highly protein-bound drug, did not result in significant changes in INR and in the pharmacokinetics of either total S-or total R-warfarin (protein bound plus free drug)

See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (7)






7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics

Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics (e.g. absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to liothyronine sodium (see Tables 1 - 4).

 Table 1: Drugs That May Decrease T3 Absorption (Hypothyroidism) 






Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of liothyronine sodium by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism.



 Drug or Drug Class


 Effect



Bile Acid Sequestrants -Colesevelam -Cholestyramine -Colestipol Ion Exchange Resins -Kayexalate -Sevelamer
Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease thyroid hormones absorption. Administer liothyronine sodium at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels.




 Table 2: Drugs That May Alter Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) 







 Drug or Drug Class


 Effect



Clofibrate Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives Estrogens (oral) Heroin / Methadone 5-Fluorouracil Mitotane Tamoxifen
These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration.


Androgens / Anabolic Steroids Asparaginase Glucocorticoids Slow-Release Nicotinic Acid
These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration.


Salicylates (>2 g/day)
Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%.


Other drugs: Carbamazepine Furosemide (>80 mg IV) Heparin Hydantoins Non-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - Fenamates
These drugs may cause protein binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increased free-T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of thyroid hormones, and total and FT4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters.




 Table 3: Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of Thyroid hormones 






Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of thyroid hormones, resulting in increased liothyronine sodium requirements.



 Drug or Drug Class


 Effect



Phenobarbital Rifampin
Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to a lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of thyroid hormones.




 Table 4: Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3 






Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased.



 Drug or Drug Class


 Effect



Beta-adrenergic antagonists (e.g., Propranolol >160 mg/day)
In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (>160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state.


Glucocorticoids (e.g., Dexamethasone ≥4 mg/day)
Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (see above).


Other drugs: Amiodarone
Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients.











7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy

Addition of liothyronine sodium therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when liothyronine sodium tablets are started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].







7.3 Oral Anticoagulants

Liothyronine sodium increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the liothyronine sodium dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments.







7.4 Digitalis Glycosides

Liothyronine sodium may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may be decreased when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides.







7.5 Antidepressant Therapy

Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and liothyronine sodium may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. Liothyronine sodium tablets may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on liothyronine sodium may result in increased liothyronine sodium requirements.







7.6 Ketamine

Concurrent use of ketamine and liothyronine sodium may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients.







7.7 Sympathomimetics

Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and liothyronine sodium may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease.







7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors

Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients.







7.9 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone in this circumstance.

7.1 	Hypercoagulability with Concomitant Use of aPCC

Clinical experience suggests that a drug interaction exists with HEMLIBRA and aPCC [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2)].








7.2	Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

HEMLIBRA restores the tenase cofactor activity of missing activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). Coagulation laboratory tests based on intrinsic clotting (i.e., aPTT) measure the total clotting time including time needed for activation of FVIII to FVIIIa by thrombin. Such intrinsic pathway-based tests will yield overly shortened clotting times with HEMLIBRA, which does not require activation by thrombin. The overly shortened intrinsic clotting time will then disturb all single-factor assays based on aPTT, such as the one-stage FVIII activity assay; however, single-factor assays utilizing chromogenic or immuno-based methods are unaffected by HEMLIBRA and may be used to monitor coagulation parameters during treatment, with specific considerations for FVIII chromogenic activity assays as described below.
Chromogenic FVIII activity tests may be manufactured with either human or bovine coagulation proteins. Assays containing human coagulation factors are responsive to HEMLIBRA but may overestimate the clinical hemostatic potential of HEMLIBRA. In contrast, assays containing bovine coagulation factors are insensitive to HEMLIBRA (no activity measured) and can be used to monitor endogenous or infused FVIII activity, or to measure anti-FVIII inhibitors.
HEMLIBRA remains active in the presence of inhibitors against FVIII, so it will produce a false-negative result in clotting-based Bethesda assays for functional inhibition of FVIII. Instead, a chromogenic Bethesda assay utilizing a bovine-based FVIII chromogenic test that is insensitive to HEMLIBRA may be used.
Due to the long half-life of HEMLIBRA, effects on coagulation assays may persist for up to 6 months after the last dose [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].",aPCC

 Tablets, USP
1 gram",DI,"Drug Interactions


Some studies have shown that simultaneous sucralfate administration in healthy volunteers reduced the extent of absorption (bioavailability) of single doses of the following: cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, and theophylline. Subtherapeutic prothrombin times with concomitant warfarin and sucralfate therapy have been reported in spontaneous and published case reports. However, two clinical studies have demonstrated no change in either serum warfarin concentration or prothrombin time with the addition of sucralfate to chronic warfarin therapy.
The mechanism of these interactions appears to be nonsystemic in nature, presumably resulting from sucralfate binding to the concomitant agent in the gastrointestinal tract. In all case studies to date (cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, digoxin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ranitidine), dosing the concomitant medication 2 hours before sucralfate eliminated the interaction. Because of the potential of Sucralfate to alter the absorption of some drugs, Sucralfate tablets should be administered separately from other drugs when alterations in bioavailability are felt to be critical.  In these cases, patients should be monitored appropriately.","cimetidine, digoxin, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, ketoconazole, l-thyroxine, phenytoin, quinidine, ranitidine, tetracycline, theophylline, warfarin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin"

7.1 Potential Interactions with Drugs that Inhibit or are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isoenzymes

Multiple hepatic cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are involved in the oxidative biotransformation of a large number of structurally different drugs and endogenous compounds. The available knowledge concerning the relationship of fluvoxamine and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system has been obtained mostly from pharmacokinetic interaction studies conducted in healthy volunteers, but some preliminary
 
  in vitrodata are also available. Based on a finding of substantial interactions of fluvoxamine with certain of these drugs [see later parts of this section and also
 
  Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5)
 
  ] and limited
 
  in vitrodata for CYP3A4, it appears that fluvoxamine inhibits several cytochrome P450 isoenzymes that are known to be involved in the metabolism of other drugs such as: CYP1A2 (e.g., warfarin, theophylline, propranolol, tizanidine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP3A4 (e.g., alprazolam), and CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole).

 

In vitrodata suggest that fluvoxamine is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6.

 
Approximately 7% of the normal population has a genetic code that leads to reduced levels of activity of CYP2D6. Such individuals have been referred to as ""poor metabolizers"" (PM) of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and tricyclic antidepressants. While none of the drugs studied for drug interactions significantly affected the pharmacokinetics of fluvoxamine, an
 
  in vivostudy of fluvoxamine single-dose pharmacokinetics in 13 PM subjects demonstrated altered pharmacokinetic properties compared to 16 ""extensive metabolizers"" (EM): mean C
 
  max, AUC, and half-life were increased by 52%, 200%, and 62%, respectively, in the PM compared to the EM group. This suggests that fluvoxamine is metabolized, at least in part, by CYP2D6. Caution is indicated in patients known to have reduced levels of CYP2D6 activity and those receiving concomitant drugs known to inhibit this cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (e.g., quinidine).

 
The metabolism of fluvoxamine has not been fully characterized and the effects of potent cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inhibition, such as the ketoconazole inhibition of CYP3A4, on fluvoxamine metabolism have not been studied.
A clinically significant fluvoxamine interaction is possible with drugs having a narrow therapeutic ratio such as pimozide, warfarin, theophylline, certain benzodiazepines, omeprazole and phenytoin. If Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets are to be administered together with a drug that is eliminated via oxidative metabolism and has a narrow therapeutic window, plasma levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects of the latter drug should be monitored closely, at least until steady-state conditions are reached

In this study, there was a slight potentiation of the propranolol-induced reduction in heart rate and reduction in the exercise diastolic pressure.

 
One case of bradycardia and hypotension and a second case of orthostatic hypotension have been reported with the coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate and metoprolol.
If propranolol or metoprolol is coadministered with Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets, a reduction in the initial beta-blocker dose and more cautious dose titration are recommended. No dosage adjustment is required for Fluvoxamine Maleate Tablets.
Coadministration of fluvoxamine maleate 100 mg per day with atenolol 100 mg per day (N=6) did not affect the plasma concentrations of atenolol. Unlike propranolol and metoprolol which undergo hepatic metabolism, atenolol is eliminated primarily by renal excretion.

Table 1 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution





 Inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6




 Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of oxycodone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 inhibitors, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to oxycodone.


 Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution until stable drug effects are achieved.Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals. If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.


 Examples:

Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)



 CYP3A4 Inducers




 Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of oxycodone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to oxycodone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the oxycodone plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression.



 Intervention:

If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.


 Examples:

Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin


 Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants



 Clinical Impact:

Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants including alcohol, can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.


 Intervention:

Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients closely for signs of respiratory depression and sedation. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.4, 5.7)].


 Examples:

Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.



 Serotonergic Drugs



 Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.


 Intervention:

If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution if serotonin syndrome is suspected.


 Examples:

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).



 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)



 Clinical Impact:

MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].


 Intervention:

The use of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.If urgent use of an opioid is necessary, use test doses and frequent titration of small doses to treat pain while closely monitoring blood pressure and signs and symptoms of CNS and respiratory depression.


 Examples:

phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid


 Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics



 Clinical Impact:

May reduce the analgesic effect of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.


 Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use.


 Examples:

butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine


 Muscle Relaxants



 Clinical Impact:

Oxycodone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.



 Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Oxycodone Hydrochloride Oral Solution and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of overdose [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.4, 5.7)].



 Diuretics



 Clinical Impact:

Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.


 Intervention:

Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.


 Anticholinergic Drugs



 Clinical Impact:

The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.

7.1 Antibiotics

Drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as rocuronium bromide include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides; vancomycin; tetracyclines; bacitracin; polymyxins; colistin; and sodium colistimethate). If these antibiotics are used in conjunction with rocuronium bromide, prolongation of neuromuscular block may occur.


7.2 Anticonvulsants

In 2 of 4 patients receiving chronic anticonvulsant therapy, apparent resistance to the effects of rocuronium bromide was observed in the form of diminished magnitude of neuromuscular block, or shortened clinical duration. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs, if rocuronium bromide is administered to patients chronically receiving anticonvulsant agents such as carbamazepine or phenytoin, shorter durations of neuromuscular block may occur and infusion rates may be higher due to the development of resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. While the mechanism for development of this resistance is not known, receptor up-regulation may be a contributing factor 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].
 


7.3 Inhalation Anesthetics

Use of inhalation anesthetics has been shown to enhance the activity of other neuromuscular blocking agents (enflurane > isoflurane > halothane).

Isoflurane and enflurane may also prolong the duration of action of initial and maintenance doses of rocuronium bromide and decrease the average infusion requirement of rocuronium bromide by 40% compared to opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. No definite interaction between rocuronium bromide and halothane has been demonstrated. In one study, use of enflurane in 10 patients resulted in a 20% increase in mean clinical duration of the initial intubating dose, and a 37% increase in the duration of subsequent maintenance doses, when compared in the same study to 10 patients under opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. The clinical duration of initial doses of rocuronium bromide of 0.57 to 0.85 mg/kg under enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia, as used clinically, was increased by 11% and 23%, respectively. The duration of maintenance doses was affected to a greater extent, increasing by 30% to 50% under either enflurane or isoflurane anesthesia.

Potentiation by these agents is also observed with respect to the infusion rates of rocuronium bromide required to maintain approximately 95% neuromuscular block. Under isoflurane and enflurane anesthesia, the infusion rates are decreased by approximately 40% compared to opioid/nitrous oxide/oxygen anesthesia. The median spontaneous recovery time (from 25% to 75% of control T
  1) is not affected by halothane, but is prolonged by enflurane (15% longer) and isoflurane (62% longer). Reversal-induced recovery of rocuronium bromide neuromuscular block is minimally affected by anesthetic technique 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
2.6
) and Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.4 Lithium Carbonate

Lithium has been shown to increase the duration of neuromuscular block and decrease infusion requirements of neuromuscular blocking agents 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.5 Local Anesthetics

Local anesthetics have been shown to increase the duration of neuromuscular block and decrease infusion requirements of neuromuscular blocking agents 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.6 Magnesium

Magnesium salts administered for the management of toxemia of pregnancy may enhance neuromuscular blockade

[see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.7 Nondepolarizing Muscle Relaxants

There are no controlled studies documenting the use of rocuronium bromide before or after other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. Interactions have been observed when other nondepolarizing muscle relaxants have been administered in succession.


7.8 Procainamide

Procainamide has been shown to increase the duration of neuromuscular block and decrease infusion requirements of neuromuscular blocking agents 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.9 Propofol

The use of propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia does not alter the clinical duration or recovery characteristics following recommended doses of rocuronium bromide.


7.10 Quinidine

Injection of quinidine during recovery from use of muscle relaxants is associated with recurrent paralysis. This possibility must also be considered for rocuronium bromide 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.10
)].



7.11 Succinylcholine

The use of rocuronium bromide before succinylcholine, for the purpose of attenuating some of the side effects of succinylcholine, has not been studied.

If rocuronium bromide is administered following administration of succinylcholine, it should not be given until recovery from succinylcholine has been observed. The median duration of action of rocuronium bromide 0.6 mg/kg administered after a 1 mg/kg dose of succinylcholine when T
  1 returned to 75% of control was 36 minutes (range: 14 to 57, n=12) vs. 28 minutes (range: 17 to 51, n=12) without succinylcholine.

Imipramine, Chlorpromazine

Imipramine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction other than a 20% decrease in peak levels of imipramine, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness. Similarly, chlorpromazine in combination with zolpidem produced no pharmacokinetic interaction, but there was an additive effect of decreased alertness and psychomotor performance 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]

  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]
         
 
  . 
        

 

Fluoxetine

After multiple doses of zolpidem tartrate and fluoxetine an increase in the zolpidem half-life (17%) was observed. There was no evidence of an additive effect in psychomotor performance 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]
         
 
  .
        

 

Haloperidol

 A study involving haloperidol and zolpidem revealed no effect of haloperidol on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of zolpidem. The lack of a drug interaction following single-dose administration does not predict the absence of an effect following chronic administration 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

  .
        

 








7.2 Drugs that Affect Drug Metabolism via Cytochrome P450

Some compounds known to induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect exposure to zolpidem. The effect of drugs that induce or inhibit other P450 enzymes on the exposure to zolpidem is not known.

CYP3A4 Inducers
          
  
   

Rifampin
Rifampin, a CYP3A4 inducer, significantly reduced the exposure to and the pharmacodynamic effects of zolpidem. Use of rifampin in combination with zolpidem may decrease the efficacy of zolpidem and is not recommended 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]

Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Celecoxib






Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis






Clinical Impact:




Celecoxib and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of Celecoxib and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.






Intervention:



Monitor patients with concomitant use of celecoxib with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet drugs (e.g., aspirin), SSRIs, and SNRIs for signs of bleeding [

].
     
          
    
     
          
    
     





Aspirin






Clinical Impact:



Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [ 
      
           
     
      
           
     
      see 
       
            
      
       
            
      
       Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
].
     
          
    
     
          
    
     
In two studies in healthy volunteers, and in patients with osteoarthritis and established heart disease respectively, celecoxib (200 mg to 400 mg daily) has demonstrated a lack of interference with the cardioprotective antiplatelet effect of aspirin (100 mg to 325 mg).





Intervention:



Concomitant use of celecoxib and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [ 
      
           
     
      
           
     
      see

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical Impact:




NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers (including propranolol).
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.






Intervention:




During concomitant use of celecoxib and ACE inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
During concomitant use of celecoxib and ACE inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [ 
       
            
      
       
            
      
       see

] 
       
            
      
       
            
      
       .

When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.






Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [ 
      
           
     
      
           
     
      see

].
     
          
    
     
          
    
     





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of Celecoxib with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical Impact:



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction). Celecoxib has no effect on methotrexate pharmacokinetics.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of celecoxib and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of Celecoxib with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [

       Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
].
     
          
    
     
          
    
     





Intervention:



The concomitant use of Celecoxib with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of celecoxib and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of celecoxib and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 mL/min to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.
NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.





CYP2C9 Inhibitors or inducers






Clinical Impact:



Celecoxib metabolism is predominantly mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 in the liver. Coadministration of celecoxib with drugs that are known to inhibit CYP2C9 (e.g., fluconazole) may enhance the exposure and toxicity of celecoxib whereas co-administration with CYP2C9 inducers (e.g., rifampin) may lead to compromised efficacy of celecoxib.





Intervention:



Evaluate each patient's medical history when consideration is given to prescribing celecoxib. A dosage adjustment may be warranted when celecoxib is administered with CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. [

].
     
          
    
     
          
    
     





CYP2D6 substrates






Clinical Impact:




In vitro studies indicate that celecoxib, although not a substrate, is an inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, there is a potential for an 
      
           
     
      
           
     
      in vivo drug interaction with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 (e.g., atomoxetine), and celecoxib may enhance the exposure and toxicity of these drugs.
     
          
    
     
          
    
     





Intervention:

The concomitant use of oxybutynin with other anticholinergic drugs or with other agents which produce dry mouth, constipation, somnolence (drowsiness), and/or other anticholinergic-like effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. 
Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. This may be of concern for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index. Anticholinergic agents may also antagonize the effects of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide.

Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic index, increased monitoring of serum digoxin concentrations and for potential signs and symptoms of clinical toxicity is necessary when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing drugs that may interact with digoxin. Prescribers should consult the prescribing information of any drug which is co-prescribed with digoxin for potential drug interaction information.
7.1 P-Glycoprotein (PGP) Inducers/Inhibitors
Digoxin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein, at the level of intestinal absorption, renal tubular section and biliary-intestinal secretion. Therefore, drugs that induce/inhibit P-glycoprotein have the potential to alter digoxin pharmacokinetics. 
7.2 Pharmacokinetic Drug Interactions
Pharmacokinetic interactions have been observed and reported primarily when digoxin is co-administered by oral route. There are very few studies that have evaluated the drug interaction when digoxin is administered via IV route. The magnitude of digoxin exposure change through IV route is generally lower than that through oral route. Table below provides available interaction data using digoxin IV formulation (NA means not available).



7.3 Potentially Significant Pharmacodynamic Drug Interactions
Because of considerable variability of pharmacodynamic interactions, the dosage of digoxin should be individualized when patients receive these medications concurrently.



7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions
Endogenous substances of unknown composition (digoxin-like immunoreactive substances [DLIS]) can interfere with standard radioimmunoassays for digoxin. The interference most often causes results to be falsely positive or falsely elevated, but sometimes it causes results to be falsely reduced. Some assays are more subject to these failings than others. Several LC/MS/MS methods are available that may provide less susceptibility to DLIS interference. DLIS are present in up to half of all neonates and in varying percentages of pregnant women, patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction, and other patients who are volume-expanded for any reason. The measured levels of DLIS (as digoxin equivalents) are usually low (0.2-0.4 ng/mL), but sometimes they reach levels that would be considered therapeutic or even toxic.
In some assays, spironolactone, canrenone, and potassium canrenoate may be falsely detected as digoxin, at levels up to 0.5 ng/mL. Some traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine substances like Chan Su, Siberian Ginseng, Asian Ginseng, Ashwagandha, or Dashen can cause similar interference.
Spironolactone and DLIS are much more extensively protein-bound than digoxin. As a result, assays of free digoxin levels in protein-free ultrafiltrate (which tend to be about 25% less than total levels, consistent with the usual extent of protein binding) are less affected by spironolactone or DLIS. It should be noted that ultrafiltration does not solve all interference problems with alternative medicines. The use of an LC/MS/MS method may be the better option according to the good results it provides, especially in terms of specificity and limit of quantization.

Other short-acting sympathomimetic aerosol bronchodilators should not be used concomitantly with albuterol. If additional adrenergic drugs are to be administered by any route, they should be used with caution to avoid deleterious cardiovascular effects.
7.1 Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Blocking Agents
Beta-blockers not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as VENTOLIN HFA, but may also produce severe bronchospasm in patients with asthma. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents for these patients; cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.
7.2 Non–Potassium-Sparing Diuretics
The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of non‑potassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acutely worsened by beta-agonists, especially when the recommended dose of the beta-agonist is exceeded. Although the clinical significance of these effects is not known, caution is advised in the coadministration of VENTOLIN HFA with non–potassium-sparing diuretics.
7.3 Digoxin
Mean decreases of 16% to 22% in serum digoxin levels were demonstrated after single-dose intravenous and oral administration of albuterol, respectively, to normal volunteers who had received digoxin for 10 days. The clinical relevance of these findings for patients with obstructive airway disease who are receiving inhaled albuterol and digoxin on a chronic basis is unclear. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to carefully evaluate the serum digoxin levels in patients who are currently receiving digoxin and albuterol.
7.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors and Tricyclic Antidepressants

Extended-Release Tablets, USP 

90 mg",DI,"Drug Interactions

Nifedipine is mainly eliminated by metabolism and is a substrate of CYP3A. Inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A can impact the exposure to nifedipine and consequently its desirable and undesirable effects. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that nifedipine can inhibit the metabolism of drugs that are substrates of CYP3A, thereby increasing the exposure to other drugs. Nifedipine is a vasodilator, and coadministration of other drugs affecting blood pressure may result in pharmacodynamic interactions.







CYP3A Inhibitors


CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, erythromycin (azithromycin, although structurally related to the class of macrolide antibiotic, is void of clinically relevant CYP3A inhibition), grapefruit, nefazodone, fluoxetine, saquinavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir may result in increased exposure to nifedipine when coadministered. Careful monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary; consider initiating nifedipine at the lowest dose available if given concomitantly with these medications.









Strong CYP3A Inducers


Strong CYP3A inducers, such as rifampin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, and St. John’s Wort reduce the bioavailability and efficacy of nifedipine; therefore nifedipine should not be used in combination with strong CYP3A inducers such as rifampin (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS
).









Cardiovascular Drugs









Antiarrhythmics










Quinidine: Quinidine is a substrate of CYP3A and has been shown to inhibit CYP3A in vitro. Coadministration of multiple doses of quinidine sulfate, 200 mg t.i.d., and nifedipine, 20 mg t.i.d., increased Cmax and AUC of nifedipine in healthy volunteers by factors of 2.30 and 1.37, respectively. The heart rate in the initial interval after drug administration was increased by up to 17.9 beats/minute. The exposure to quinidine was not importantly changed in the presence of nifedipine. Monitoring of heart rate and adjustment of the nifedipine dose, if necessary, are recommended when quinidine is added to a treatment with nifedipine.










Flecainide: There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine to recommend concomitant use.













Calcium Channel Blockers










Diltiazem: Pretreatment of healthy volunteers with 30 mg or 90 mg t.i.d. diltiazem p.o. increased the AUC of nifedipine after a single dose of 20 mg nifedipine by factors of 2.2 and 3.1, respectively. The corresponding Cmax values of nifedipine increased by factors of 2.0 and 1.7, respectively. Caution should be exercised when coadministering diltiazem and nifedipine and a reduction of the dose of nifedipine should be considered.










Verapamil: Verapamil, a CYP3A inhibitor, can inhibit the metabolism of nifedipine and increase the exposure to nifedipine during concomitant therapy. Blood pressure should be monitored and reduction of the dose of nifedipine considered.













ACE Inhibitors










Benazepril: In healthy volunteers receiving single dose of 20 mg nifedipine ER and benazepril 10 mg, the plasma concentrations of benazeprilat and nifedipine in the presence and absence of each other were not statistically significantly different. A hypotensive effect was only seen after coadministration of the two drugs. The tachycardic effect of nifedipine was attenuated in the presence of benazepril.













Angiotensin-II Blockers










Irbesartan: In vitro studies show significant inhibition of the formation of oxidized irbesartan metabolites by nifedipine. However, in clinical studies, concomitant nifedipine had no effect on irbesartan pharmacokinetics.










Candesartan: No significant drug interaction has been reported in studies with candesartan cilexitil given together with nifedipine. Because candesartan is not significantly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and at therapeutic concentrations has no effect on cytochrome P450 enzymes, interactions with drugs that inhibit or are metabolized by those enzymes would not be expected.













Beta-Blockers


Nifedipine extended-release tablet was well tolerated when administered in combination with beta-blockers in 187 hypertensive patients in a placebo-controlled clinical trial. However, there have been occasional literature reports suggesting that the combination of nifedipine and beta-adrenergic blocking drugs may increase the likelihood of congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, or exacerbation of angina in patients with cardiovascular disease. Clinical monitoring is recommended, and a dose adjustment of nifedipine should be considered.








Timolol: Hypotension is more likely to occur if dihydropryridine calcium antagonists such as nifedipine are coadministered with timolol.













Central Alpha1-Blockers










Doxazosin: Healthy volunteers participating in a multiple dose doxazosin-nifedipine interaction study received 2 mg doxazosin q.d. alone or combined with 20 mg nifedipine ER b.i.d. Coadministration of nifedipine resulted in a decrease in AUC and Cmax of doxazosin to 83% and 86% of the values in the absence of nifedipine, respectively. In the presence of doxazosin, AUC and Cmax of nifedipine were increased by factors of 1.13 and 1.23, respectively. Compared to nifedipine monotherapy, blood pressure was lower in the presence of doxazosin. Blood pressure should be monitored when doxazosin is coadministered with nifedipine and dose reduction of nifedipine considered.













Digitalis










Digoxin: The simultaneous administration of nifedipine and digoxin may lead to reduced clearance resulting in an increase in plasma concentrations of digoxin. Since there have been isolated reports of patients with elevated digoxin levels, and there is a possible interaction between digoxin and nifedipine extended-release tablet, it is recommended that digoxin levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting, and discontinuing nifedipine extended-release tablet to avoid possible over- or under-digitalization. 













Antithrombotics










Coumarins: There have been rare reports of increased prothrombin time in patients taking coumarin anticoagulants to whom nifedipine was administered. However, the relationship to nifedipine therapy is uncertain.













Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors










Clopidogrel: No clinically significant pharmacodynamic interactions were observed when clopidogrel was coadministered with nifedipine.










Tirofiban: Coadministration of nifedipine did not alter the exposure to tirofiban importantly.

No formal drug interaction studies have been conducted in humans.
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate has the potential to bind other drugs. In in vitro binding studies, sodium polystyrene sulfonate was shown to significantly bind the oral medications (n=6) that were tested. Decreased absorption of lithium and thyroxine have also been reported with co-administration of sodium polystyrene sulfonate. Binding of sodium polystyrene sulfonate to other oral medications could cause decreased gastrointestinal absorption and loss of efficacy when taken close to the time sodium polystyrene sulfonate is administered.

7.1 Potential for RUKOBIA to Affect Other Drugs 

Temsavir may increase plasma concentrations of grazoprevir or voxilaprevir to a clinically relevant extent due to organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1/3 inhibition [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].
When RUKOBIA was coadministered with oral contraceptives, temsavir increased concentrations of ethinyl estradiol (Table 3) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect RUKOBIA

Coadministration of RUKOBIA with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, significantly decreases temsavir plasma concentrations. The use of RUKOBIA with drugs that are strong inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly decrease temsavir plasma concentrations which may lead to loss of virologic response [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

7.1 Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Simvastatin Tablets

Simvastatin tablet is a substrate of CYP3A4 and of the transport protein OATP1B1. Simvastatin tablets exposure can be significantly increased with concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1. Table 2 includes a list of drugs that increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly with simvastatin tablets and instructions for preventing or managing them
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)and
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3).]
 
  


Table 2: Drug Interactions that Increase the Risk of Myopathy and Rhabdomyolysis with Simvastatin Tablets







Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors





Clinical Impact:


 Simvastatin is a substrate of CYP3A4. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with simvastatin increases simvastatin exposure and increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, particularly with higher simvastatin dosages. 
     




Intervention:


 Concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with simvastatin is contraindicated
    
     [see Contraindications (
     
      4)].
    
     If treatment with a CYP3A4 inhibitor is unavoidable, suspend simvastatin during the course of strong CYP3A4 inhibitor treatment. 
     




Examples:


 Select azole anti-fungals (e.g., itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole), select macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin and clarithromycin), select HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., nelfinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir/ritonavir), select HCV protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir and telaprevir), cobicistat-containing products, and nefazodone. 
     




Cyclosporine, Danazol, or Gemfibrozil





Clinical Impact:


 The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine, danazol, or gemfibrozil with simvastatin. Gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone. 
     




Intervention:


 Concomitant use of cyclosporine, danazol, or gemfibrozil with simvastatin is contraindicated
    
     [see Contraindications (
     
      4)].
    
     





Amiodarone, Dronedarone, Ranolazine, or Calcium Channel Blockers





Clinical Impact:


 The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of amiodarone, dronedarone, ranolazine, or calcium channel blockers with simvastatin. 
     




Intervention:


 For patients taking verapamil, diltiazem, or dronedarone, do not exceed simvastatin 10 mg daily
    
     .For patients taking amiodarone, amlodipine, or ranolazine, do not exceed simvastatin 20 mg daily
    
     [see Dosage and Administration (
     
      2.5)].
    
     





Lomitapide





Clinical Impact:


 Simvastatin exposure is approximately doubled with concomitant use of lomitapide and the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased
    
     .





Intervention:


 Reduce the dose of simvastatin by 50% if initiating lomitapide. Do not exceed simvastatin 20 mg daily (or simvastatin 40 mg daily for patients who have previously taken an 80 mg daily dosage of simvastatin chronically) while taking lomitapide
    
     [see Dosage and Administration (
     
      2.1,
     
      2.5)].
    
     





Daptomycin





Clinical Impact:


 Cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported with simvastatin administered with daptomycin. Both simvastatin and daptomycin can cause myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when given alone and the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis may be increased by coadministration. 
     




Intervention:


 If treatment with daptomycin is required, consider temporarily suspending simvastatin during the course of daptomycin treatment. 
     




Niacin





Clinical Impact:


 Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of lipid modifying dosages of niacin-containing products (≥1 gram/day niacin) with simvastatin. The risk of myopathy is greater in Chinese patients. In a clinical study (median follow-up 3.9 years) of patients at high risk of CVD and with well-controlled LDL-C levels on simvastatin 40 mg/day with or without ezetimibe 10 mg/day, there was no incremental benefit on cardiovascular outcomes with the addition of lipid-modifying doses of niacin. 
     




Intervention:


 Concomitant use of simvastatin with lipid-modifying dosages of niacin is not recommended in Chinese patients
    
     [see Use in Specific Populations (
     
      8.8)].
    
     For non-Chinese patients, consider if the benefit of using lipid-modifying doses of niacin concomitantly with simvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 
     




Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil)





Clinical Impact:


 Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with simvastatin. 
     




Intervention:


 Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with simvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 
     




Colchicine





Clinical Impact:


 Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with simvastatin. 
     




Intervention:


 Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with simvastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug. 
     




Grapefruit Juice





Clinical Impact:


 Grapefruit juice can raise the plasma levels of simvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. 
     




Intervention:


 Avoid grapefruit juice when taking simvastatin. 
     












7.2 Simvastatin Tablets Effects on Other Drugs

Table 3 presents simvastatin tablet’s effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them.


Table 3: Simvastatin Tablet’s Effects on Other Drugs











Coumarin Anticoagulants





Clinical Impact:


 Simvastatin may potentiate the effect of coumarin anticoagulants and increase the INR. The concomitant use of simvastatin (20 to 40 mg) and coumarin anticoagulants increased the INR from a baseline of 1.7 to 1.8 in healthy subjects and from 2.6 to 3.4 in patients with hyperlipidemia. There are postmarketing reports of clinically evident bleeding and/or increased INR in patients taking concomitant statins and warfarin. 
     




Intervention:


 In patients taking coumarin anticoagulants, obtain an INR before starting simvastatin and frequently enough after initiation, dose titration, or discontinuation to ensure that no significant alteration in INR occurs. Once the INR is stable, monitor INR at regularly recommended intervals. 
     




Digoxin





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of digoxin with simvastatin may result in elevated plasma digoxin concentrations
    
     [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)]
    
     .

7.1 Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4

Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. The use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, ketoconazole, telithromycin, conivaptan, lopinavir, nefazodone, voriconazole) with fluticasone propionate nasal spray is not recommended because increased systemic corticosteroid adverse effects may occur.


Ritonavir


A drug interaction trial with fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray in healthy subjects has shown that ritonavir (a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) can significantly increase plasma fluticasone propionate exposure, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
 
  During postmarketing use, there have been reports of clinically significant drug interactions in patients receiving fluticasone propionate products, including fluticasone propionate, with ritonavir, resulting in systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing’s syndrome and adrenal suppression.

 


Ketoconazole


Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol area under the curve (AUC), but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.Drug Interactions



Inhibitors of Cytochrome P450 3A4


Ritonavir: Fluticasone propionate is a substrate of CYP3A4. Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, ritonavir, is not recommended based upon a multiple-dose, crossover drug interaction trial in 18 healthy subjects. Fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray (200 mcg once daily) was coadministered for 7 days with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily). Plasma fluticasone propionate concentrations following fluticasone propionate aqueous nasal spray alone were undetectable (<10 pg/mL) in most subjects, and when concentrations were detectable, peak levels (C
 
  max) averaged 11.9 pg/mL (range: 10.8 to 14.1 pg/mL) and AUC

This significant increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure resulted in a significant decrease (86%) in serum cortisol AUC.

 

Ketoconazole

Coadministration of orally inhaled fluticasone propionate (1,000 mcg) and ketoconazole (200 mg once daily) resulted in a 1.9-fold increase in plasma fluticasone propionate exposure and a 45% decrease in plasma cortisol AUC but had no effect on urinary excretion of cortisol.

APPRAISE-2, a placebo-controlled clinical trial of ELIQUIS in high-risk, post-acute coronary syndrome patients treated with aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel, was terminated early due to a higher rate of bleeding with ELIQUIS compared to placebo. The rate of ISTH major bleeding was 2.8% per year with ELIQUIS versus 0.6% per year with placebo in patients receiving single antiplatelet therapy and was 5.9% per year with ELIQUIS versus 2.5% per year with placebo in those receiving dual antiplatelet therapy.
In ARISTOTLE, concomitant use of aspirin increased the bleeding risk on ELIQUIS from 1.8% per year to 3.4% per year and concomitant use of aspirin and warfarin increased the bleeding risk from 2.7% per year to 4.6% per year.

Ethacrynic acid may increase the ototoxic potential of other drugs such as aminoglycoside and some cephalosporin antibiotics. Their concurrent use should be avoided.
A number of drugs, including ethacrynic acid, have been shown to displace warfarin from plasma protein; a reduction in the usual anticoagulant dosage may be required in patients receiving both drugs.
In some patients, the administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effects of loop, potassium-sparing and thiazide diuretics.

Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Sufentanil Citrate Injection






Inhibitors of CYP3A4 







Clinical Impact:




The concomitant use of Sufentanil Citrate Injection and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of sufentanil, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of Sufentanil Citrate Injection is achieved [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the sufentanil plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to sufentanil.






Intervention:




If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of Sufentanil Citrate Injection until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients at frequent intervals for respiratory depression and sedation.

If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the Sufentanil Citrate Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal.






Examples:




Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), grapefruit juice.





CYP3A4 Inducers







Clinical Impact:




The concomitant use of Sufentanil Citrate Injection and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of sufentanil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to sufentanil [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the sufentanil plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions and may cause serious respiratory depression.






Intervention:




If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the Sufentanil Citrate Injection dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider Sufentanil Citrate Injection dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression.






Examples:




Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin





Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants







Clinical Impact:




The concomitant use of Sufentanil Citrate Injection with CNS depressants my result in decreased pulmonary artery pressure and may cause hypotension. Even small dosages of diazepam may cause cardiovascular depression when added to high dose or anesthetic dosages of Sufentanil Citrate Injection. As postoperative analgesia, concomitant use of Sufentanil Citrate Injection can increase the risk of hypotension, respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].






Intervention:




As postoperative analgesia, start with a lower dose of Sufentanil Citrate Injection and monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension. Fluids or other measures to counter hypotension should be available [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.3)

].






Examples:




Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs







Clinical Impact:




The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.8)

].







Intervention:




If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue Sufentanil Citrate Injection if serotonin syndrome is suspected.






Examples:




Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that effect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)







Clinical Impact:




MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].







Intervention:




The use of Sufentanil Citrate Injection is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.






Examples:




phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics







Clinical Impact:




May reduce the analgesic effect of Sufentanil Citrate Injection and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.






Intervention:




Avoid concomitant use.






Examples:




butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine





Muscle Relaxants







Clinical Impact:




Sufentanil may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.






Intervention:




Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of Sufentanil Citrate Injection and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary.





Diuretics







Clinical Impact:




Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.






Intervention:




Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs







Clinical Impact:




The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.






Intervention:




Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when Sufentanil Citrate Injection is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.





Nitrous oxide







Clinical Impact:




Nitrous oxide has been reported to produce cardiovascular depression when given with higher doses of Sufentanil Citrate Injection.






Intervention:




Monitor patients for signs of cardiovascular depression that may be greater than otherwise expected.

Cimetidine


There is evidence that cimetidine inhibits the elimination of tricyclic antidepressants. Downward adjustment of trimipramine maleate capsules dosage may be required if cimetidine therapy is initiated; upward adjustment if cimetidine therapy is discontinued.









Alcohol


Patients should be warned that the concomitant use of alcoholic beverages may be associated with exaggerated effects.









Catecholamines/Anticholinergics


It has been reported that tricyclic antidepressants can potentiate the effects of catecholamines. Similarly, atropine-like effects may be more pronounced in patients receiving anticholinergic therapy. Therefore, particular care should be exercised when it is necessary to administer tricyclic antidepressants with sympathomimetic amines, local decongestants, local anesthetics containing epinephrine, atropine or drugs with an anticholinergic effect. In resistant cases of depression in adults, a dose of 2.5 mg/kg/day may have to be exceeded. If a higher dose is needed, ECG monitoring should be maintained during the initiation of therapy and at appropriate intervals during stabilization of dose.









Drugs Metabolized by P450 2D6


The biochemical activity of the drug metabolizing isozyme cytochrome P450 2D6 (debrisoquin hydroxylase) is reduced in a subset of the caucasian population (about 7-10% of caucasians are so called ""poor metabolizers""); reliable estimates of the prevalence of reduced P450 2D6 isozyme activity among Asian, African, and other populations are not yet available. Poor metabolizers have higher than expected plasma concentrations of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) when given usual doses. Depending on the fraction of drug metabolized by P450 2D6, the increase in plasma concentration may be small, or quite large (8 fold increase in plasma AUC of the TCA).
In addition, certain drugs inhibit the activity of the isozyme and make normal metabolizers resemble poor metabolizers. An individual who is stable on a given dose of TCA may become abruptly toxic when given one of these inhibiting drugs as concomitant therapy. The drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 include some that are not metabolized by the enzyme (quinidine; cimetidine) and many that are substrates for P450 2D6  (many other antidepressants, phenothiazines, and the Type 1C antiarrhythmics propafenone and flecainide). While all the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine, inhibit P450 2D6, they may vary in the extent of inhibition. The extent to which SSRI TCA interactions may pose clinical problems will depend on the degree of inhibition and the pharmacokinetics of the SSRI involved. Nevertheless, caution is indicated in the co-administration of TCAs with any of the SSRIs and also in switching from one class to the other. Of particular importance, sufficient time must elapse before initiating TCA treatment in a patient being withdrawn from fluoxetine, given the long half-life of the parent and active metabolite (at least 5 weeks may be necessary).
Concomitant use of tricyclic antidepressants with drugs that can inhibit cytochrome P450 2D6 may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either the tricyclic antidepressant or the other drug. Furthermore, whenever one of these other drugs is withdrawn from co-therapy, an increased dose of tricyclic antidepressant may be required. It is desirable to monitor TCA plasma levels whenever a TCA is going to be co-administered with another drug known to be an inhibitor of P450 2D6.

Initial U.S. Approval: 2003",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS





Coadministration of atazanavir can alter the concentration of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of atazanavir. The potential drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 7, 12.3)







7.1 Potential for Atazanavir to Affect Other Drugs

Atazanavir is an inhibitor of CYP3A and UGT1A1. Coadministration of atazanavir and drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A or UGT1A1 may result in increased plasma concentrations of the other drug that could increase or prolong its therapeutic and adverse effects. 
Atazanavir is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C8. Use of atazanavir without ritonavir is not recommended when coadministered with drugs highly dependent on CYP2C8 with narrow therapeutic indices (eg, paclitaxel, repaglinide). When atazanavir with ritonavir is coadministered with substrates of CYP2C8, clinically significant interactions are not expected [see Clinical Pharmacology, Table 22 (12.3)].

The magnitude of CYP3A-mediated drug interactions on coadministered drug may change when atazanavir is coadministered with ritonavir. See the complete prescribing information for ritonavir for information on drug interactions with ritonavir.








7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Atazanavir

Atazanavir is a CYP3A4 substrate; therefore, drugs that induce CYP3A4 may decrease atazanavir plasma concentrations and reduce atazanavir’s therapeutic effect.
Atazanavir solubility decreases as pH increases. Reduced plasma concentrations of atazanavir are expected if proton-pump inhibitors, antacids, buffered medications, or H2-receptor antagonists are administered with atazanavir [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4, and 2.6)].









7.3 Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Table 16 provides dosing recommendations in adults as a result of drug interactions with atazanavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction studies or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious events or loss of efficacy.

Whenever an H2RA is given to a patient receiving atazanavir with ritonavir, the H2RA dose should not exceed a dose comparable to famotidine 20 mg twice daily, and the atazanavir with ritonavir doses should be administered simultaneously with, and/or at least 10 hours after, the dose of the H2RA.

Atazanavir 300 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with an H2RA. 
Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA. 
Atazanavir 400 mg with ritonavir 100 mg once daily (all as a single dose with food) if taken with either tenofovir DF or an H2RA for pregnant patients during the second and third trimester. Atazanavir is not recommended for pregnant patients during the second and third trimester taking atazanavir with both tenofovir DF and an H2RA. 






Hormonal contraceptives: ethinyl estradiol and norgestimate or norethindrone


↓ ethinyl estradiol
↑ norgestimatec

↑ ethinyl estradiol
↑ norethindroned



Use caution if considering coadministration of oral contraceptives with atazanavir or atazanavir with ritonavir.
If atazanavir with ritonavir is coadministered with an oral contraceptive, it is recommended that the oral contraceptive contain at least 35 mcg of ethinyl estradiol.
If atazanavir is administered without ritonavir, the oral contraceptive should contain no more than 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol.
Potential safety risks include substantial increases in progesterone exposure. The long-term effects of increases in concentration of the progestational agent are unknown and could increase the risk of insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and acne.
Coadministration of atazanavir or atazanavir with ritonavir and other hormonal contraceptives (eg, contraceptive patch, contraceptive vaginal ring, or injectable contraceptives) or oral contraceptives containing progestogens other than norethindrone or norgestimate, or less than 25 mcg of ethinyl estradiol, has not been studied; therefore, alternative methods of contraception are recommended.

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents






Clinical Impact:





•Potentiation and prolongation of neuromuscular blockade is possible with the concomitant use of magnesium sulfate and neuromuscular blocking agents [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

•The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve suppression of peripheral neuromuscular function by decreasing acetylcholine release, reduction of endplate sensitivity, and decreased muscle fiber excitability with magnesium sulfate therapy.






Intervention:





•Monitor respiration and the depth of neuromuscular blockade frequently (e.g., train-of-four monitoring) when a neuromuscular blocking agent is used concomitantly with Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection.

•Adjust the dosage of the neuromuscular blocking agent accordingly to maintain the desired level of musculoskeletal activity. The amount of reversal agent(s) required to achieve adequate reversal of the neuromuscular blocking agent(s) may also be increased.






Examples:





•Depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: succinylcholine

•Non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockers: atracurium, cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium, vecuronium






Narcotics and/or Propofol






Clinical Impact:





•Potentiation and prolongation of analgesia and CNS depression is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with narcotics and/or propofol. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other CNS depressants is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

•The underlying mechanism of this interaction may involve antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) by magnesium sulfate therapy.






Intervention:





•Monitor the depth of CNS depression frequently using a reliable instrument.

•Adjust the narcotic and/or propofol dosage accordingly to maintain the desired level of analgesia and sedation.






Examples:





•Narcotics and propofol






Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel Blockers






Clinical Impact:





•An exaggerated hypotensive response is possible with the concomitant use of Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. The potential for magnesium sulfate to affect other calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem and verapamil) is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].






Intervention:





•Monitor vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiration) frequently.

•Supportive care and/or discontinuation of the calcium channel blocker may be required.






Examples:





•Amlodipine, clevidipine, felodipine, isradipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, nimodipine, and nisoldipine

8477821/0723F",DI,"Drug Interactions

Since mexiletine hydrochloride is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations. In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2. In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine. Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QT
  c, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone. When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect.
 
In a large compassionate use program mexiletine has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions. A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with mexiletine, lowered mexiletine plasma levels have been reported. Monitoring of mexiletine plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy.
In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect mexiletine plasma concentrations. ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent mexiletine and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol.
Concurrent administration of cimetidine and mexiletine has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged mexiletine plasma levels; therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy.
Mexiletine does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to mexiletine, has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels.
Concurrent use of mexiletine and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels. One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35 to 136%) in plasma theophylline levels. This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting mexiletine. Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-mexiletine values within 48 hours after discontinuing mexiletine. If mexiletine and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the mexiletine dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered.
Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of mexiletine.","fluvoxamine, propafenone, quinidine, propranolol, phenytoin, rifampin, phenobarbital, digoxin, diuretics, cimetidine, magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, theophylline, caffeine"

7.1 Drugs Affecting Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes
Ondansetron does not appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron [see 
  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs.
 
7.2 Apomorphine
Based on reports of profound hypotension and loss of consciousness when apomorphine was administered with ondansetron, the concomitant use of apomorphine with ondansetron is contraindicated [see 
  Contraindications (4)].
 
7.3 Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampin
In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs [see 
  Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
7.4 Tramadol
Although there are no data on pharmacokinetic drug interactions between ondansetron and tramadol, data from two small trials indicate that concomitant use of ondansetron may result in reduced analgesic activity of tramadol. Patients on concomitant ondansetron self administered tramadol more frequently in these trials, leading to an increased cumulative dose in patient-controlled administration (PCA) of tramadol.
7.5 Serotonergic Drugs
Serotonin syndrome (including altered mental status, autonomic instability, and neuromuscular symptoms) has been described following the concomitant use of 5-HT
  3 receptor antagonists and other serotonergic drugs, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see 
  Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
 
7.6 Chemotherapy
In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron.
In a crossover trial in 76 pediatric patients, intravenous ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.
7.7 Temazepam
The coadministration of ondansetron had no effect on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of temazepam.
7.8 Alfentanil and Atracurium
Ondansetron does not alter the respiratory depressant effects produced by alfentanil or the degree of neuromuscular blockade produced by atracurium.

7.1 PDE-5-Inhibitors and sGC-Stimulators
Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are using a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5). PDE-5-Inhibitors such as avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadalafil have been shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of organic nitrates.
Nitroglycerin Lingual Spray is contraindicated in patients who are taking soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulators. Concomitant use can cause hypotension.
The time course and dose dependence of these interactions have not been studied, and use within a few days of one another is not recommended. Appropriate supportive care for the severe hypotension has not been studied, but it seems reasonable to treat this as a nitrate overdose, with elevation of the extremities and with central volume expansion.
7.2 Antihypertensives
Patients receiving antihypertensive drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers, and nitrates should be observed for possible additive hypotensive effects. Marked orthostatic hypotension has been reported when calcium channel blockers and organic nitrates were used concomitantly.
Beta-adrenergic blockers blunt the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effects. If beta-blockers are used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional hypotensive effects may occur.
7.3 Ergotamine
Oral administration of nitroglycerin markedly decreases the first-pass metabolism of dihydroergotamine and subsequently increases its oral bioavailability. Ergotamine is known to precipitate angina pectoris. Therefore, patients receiving sublingual nitroglycerin should avoid ergotamine and related drugs or be monitored for symptoms of ergotism if this is not possible.","avanafil, sildenafil, vardenafil, tadalafil, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine"

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Alprazolam 


Table 4 includes clinically significant drug interactions with alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Alprazolam






Opioids






Clinical implication 


The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at gammaaminobutyric acid(GABAA) sites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. 




Prevention or management 


Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of alprazolam and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.1)]. 





Examples 


Morphine, buprenorphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, methadone, alfentanil, butorpenol, codeine, dihydrocodeine, meperidine, pentazocine, remifentanil, sufentanil, tapentadol, tramadol. 





CNS Depressants





Clinical implication 


The benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, produce additive CNS depressant effects when coadministered with other CNS depressants. 




Prevention or management 


Limit dosage and duration of alprazolam during concomitant use with CNS depressants [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 




Examples 


Psychotropic medications, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other drugs which themselves produce CNS depression. 





Strong Inhibitors of CYP3A (except ritonavir)





Clinical implication 


Concomitant use of alprazolam with strong CYP3A inhibitors has a profound effect on the clearance of alprazolam, resulting in increased concentrations of alprazolam and increased risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 





Prevention or management 


Concomitant use of alprazolam with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor (except ritonavir) is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 





Examples 


Ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin 





Moderate or Weak Inhibitors of CYP3A





Clinical implication 


Concomitant use of alprazolam with CYP3A inhibitors may increase the concentrations of alprazolam, resulting in increased risk of adverse reactions of alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 





Prevention or management 


Avoid use and consider appropriate dose reduction when alprazolam is coadministered with a moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 





Examples 


Nefazodone, fluvoxamine, cimetidine, erythromycin 





CYP3A Inducers





Clinical implication 


Concomitant use of CYP3A inducers can increase alprazolam metabolism and therefore can decease plasma levels of alprazolam [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 




Prevention or management 


Caution is recommended during coadministration with alprazolam. 




Examples 


Carbamazepine, phenytoin 





Ritonavir





Clinical implication 


Interactions involving ritonavir and alprazolam are complex and time dependent. Short term administration of ritonavir increased alprazolam exposure due to CYP3A4 inhibition. Following long term treatment of ritonavir (>10 to 14 days), CYP3A4 induction offsets this inhibition. Alprazolam exposure was not meaningfully affected in the presence of ritonavir. 




Prevention or management 


Reduce alprazolam dosage when ritonavir and alprazolam are initiated concomitantly, or when ritonavir is added to a regimen where alprazolam is stabilized. 
Increase alprazolam dosage to the target dosage after 10 to 14 days of dosing ritonavir and alprazolam concomitantly. No dosage adjustment of alprazolam is necessary in patients receiving ritonavir for more than 10 to14 days [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 
Concomitant use of alprazolam with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, except ritonavir, is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. 






Digoxin





Clinical implication 


Increased digoxin concentrations have been reported when alprazolam was given, especially in geriatric patients( >65 years of age). 




Prevention or management 


In patients on digoxin therapy, measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating alprazolam. Continue monitoring digoxin serum concentration and toxicity frequently. Reduce the digoxin dose if necessary.

Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants






Clinical Impact:



Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.





Intervention:



Cessation of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants is preferred in most cases of concomitant use. In some cases, monitoring in a higher level of care for taper may be appropriate. In others, gradually tapering a patient off of a prescribed benzodiazepine or other CNS depressant or decreasing to the lowest effective dose may be appropriate.
Before co-prescribing benzodiazepines for anxiety or insomnia, ensure that patients are appropriately diagnosed and consider alternative medications and non-pharmacologic treatments [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
If concomitant use is warranted, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose, as is recommended for all patients in treatment for opioid use disorder [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].





Examples:



Alcohol, benzodiazepines, and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids.





Inhibitors of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6






Clinical Impact:



Methadone undergoes hepatic N-demethylation by several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, including CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6. The concomitant use of methadone and CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of methadone, resulting in increased or prolonged opioid effects, and may result in a fatal overdose, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of methadone is achieved. These effects may be more pronounced with concomitant use of drugs that inhibit more than one of the CYP enzymes listed above.
After stopping a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the methadone plasma concentration can decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or withdrawal symptoms in patients physically dependent on methadone.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of methadone until  stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals.
If a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, follow patients for signs of opioid withdrawal and consider increasing the methadone dosage until stable drug effects are achieved.





Examples:



Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g., ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir), fluconazole, fluvoxamine, some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g., sertraline, fluvoxamine)





Inducers of CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of methadone and CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of methadone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of withdrawal symptoms in patients physically dependent on methadone. These effects could be more pronounced with concomitant use of drugs that can induce multiple CYP enzymes.
After stopping a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the methadone plasma concentration can increase [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause serious respiratory depression, sedation, or death.





Intervention:



If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the methadone dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Monitor for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, or CYP2C9 inducer is discontinued, consider methadone dosage reduction and monitor for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.





Examples:



Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John’s Wort, Phenobarbital





Potentially Arrhythmogenic Agents






Clinical Impact:



Pharmacodynamic interactions may occur with concomitant use of methadone and potentially arrhythmogenic agents or drugs capable of inducing electrolyte disturbances (hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia).





Intervention:



Monitor patients closely for cardiac conduction changes.





Examples:



Drugs known to have potential to prolong QT interval: Class I and III antiarrhythmics, some neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants, and calcium channel blockers. Drugs capable of inducing electrolyte disturbances: Diuretics, laxatives, and, in rare cases, mineralocortocoid
hormones.





Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (
5.9
)].





Intervention:



If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue methadone if serotonin syndrome is suspected.





Examples:



Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.9)].





Intervention:



The use of methadone is not recommended for patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.





Examples:



phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics






Clinical Impact:



Patients maintained on methadone may experience withdrawal symptoms when given opioid antagonists, mixed agonist/antagonists, and partial agonists.





Intervention:



Avoid concomitant use.





Examples:



butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine





Muscle Relaxants






Clinical Impact:



Methadone may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of respiratory depression that may be greater than otherwise expected and decrease the dosage of methadone and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, strongly consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (
2.3
), Warnings and Precautions (
5.1
, 
5.2
)].






Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when methadone is used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.





Paradoxical Effects of Anti-Retroviral Agents on Methadone 

Concurrent use of certain protease inhibitors with CYP3A4 inhibitory activity, alone and in combination, such as abacavir, amprenavir, darunavir+ritonavir, efavirenz, nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir, telaprevir, lopinavir+ritonavir, saquinavir+ritonavir, and tipranvir+ritonavir, has resulted in increased clearance or decreased plasma levels of methadone. This may result in reduced efficacy of methadone and could precipitate a withdrawal syndrome. Monitor patients receiving methadone and any of these anti-retroviral therapies closely for evidence of withdrawal effects and adjust the methadone dose accordingly.

Effects of Methadone on Anti-Retroviral Agents 



 
Didanosine and Stavudine
Experimental evidence demonstrated that methadone decreased the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak levels for didanosine and stavudine, with a more significant decrease for didanosine. Methadone disposition was not substantially altered. 


 
Zidovudine 


 Experimental evidence demonstrated that methadone increased the AUC of zidovudine which could result in toxic effects. 


Effects of Methadone on Antidepressants 



 
Desipramine 


 Plasma levels of desipramine have increased with concurrent methadone administration.

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of irbesartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia, sometimes severe. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.








7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported with concomitant use of irbesartan and lithium. Monitor lithium levels in patients receiving irbesartan and lithium.








7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including irbesartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving irbesartan and NSAID therapy. 
    The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including irbesartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.
 








7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)


Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on irbesartan and other agents that affect the RAS. 
    Do not co-administer aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with irbesartan in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).

CNS Depressants

The sedative effects of metaxalone and other CNS depressants (e.g., alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)) may be additive. Exercise caution with patients who take more than one of these CNS depressants simultaneously. Follow patients closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation (see
 
  WARNINGS).

 


Serotonergic Drugs


Serotonin syndrome has resulted from concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with metaxalone used within the recommended dosage range (see
 
  WARNINGS). If concomitant use is warranted, carefully observe the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue metaxalone if serotonin syndrome is suspected.

 
Examples of serotonergic drugs include: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, opioids (particularly fentanyl, meperidine, and methadone), drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).","alcohol, benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, linezolid, intravenous methylene blue"

Initial U.S. Approval: 1976",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with naproxen.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with naproxen








Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis






Clinical Impact:




Naproxen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of naproxen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.






Intervention:


Monitor patients with concomitant use of naproxen tablets with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [
    
     see
     
      Warnings and Precautions (5.12)
].
   
    




Aspirin






Clinical Impact:



A pharmacodynamic (PD) study has demonstrated an interaction in which lower dose naproxen (220mg/day or 220mg twice daily) interfered with the antiplatelet effect of low-dose immediate-release aspirin, with the interaction most marked during the washout period of naproxen
(
     
      see
      
       12.2 Pharmacodynamics
). There is reason to expect that the interaction would be present with prescription doses of naproxen or with enteric-coated low-dose aspirin; however, the peak interference with aspirin function may be later than observed in the PD study due to the longer washout period.
    
     

  Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [
     
      see
      
       Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
].
    
     





Intervention:



Because there may be an increased risk of cardiovascular events following discontinuation of naproxen due to the interference with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin during the washout period, for patients taking low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection who require intermittent analgesics, consider use of an NSAID that does not interfere with the antiplatelet effect of aspirin, or non-NSAID analgesics where appropriate.

  Concomitant use of naproxen tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [
     
      see
      
       Warnings and Precautions (5.12)
].
    
     

  Naproxen tablets are not substitutes for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.
     





ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical Impact:




NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.






Intervention:




During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [
      
       see
       
        Warnings and Precautions (5.6)
].
     
      
When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.






Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [
     
      see
      
       Warnings and Precautions (5.6)
].
    
     





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of naproxen tablets with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical Impact:



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of naproxen tablets and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [
     
      see
      
       Warnings and Precautions (5.2)
].
    
     





Intervention:



The concomitant use of naproxen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of naproxen tablets and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of naproxen tablets and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 mL/min to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.

  NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.
     

  In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.
     





Antacids and Sucralfate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant administration of some antacids (magnesium oxide or aluminum hydroxide) and sucralfate can delay the absorption of naproxen.





Intervention:



Concomitant administration of antacids such as magnesium oxide or aluminum hydroxide, and sucralfate with naproxen tablets is not recommended.





Cholestyramine






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant administration of cholestyramine can delay the absorption of naproxen.





Intervention:



Concomitant administration of cholestyramine with naproxen is not recommended.





Probenecid






Clinical Impact:



Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen tablets anion plasma levels and extends its plasma half-life significantly.





Intervention:



Patients simultaneously receiving naproxen and probenecid should be observed for adjustment of dose if required.





Other albumin-bound drugs






Clinical Impact:



Naproxen is highly bound to plasma albumin; it thus has a theoretical potential for interaction with other albumin-bound drugs such as coumarin-type anticoagulants, sulphonylureas, hydantoins, other NSAIDs, and aspirin.





Intervention:



Patients simultaneously receiving naproxen tablets and a hydantoin, sulphonamide or sulphonylurea should be observed for adjustment of dose if required.





Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions









Bleeding times






Clinical Impact:



Naproxen may decrease platelet aggregation and prolong bleeding time.





Intervention:



This effect should be kept in mind when bleeding times are determined.





Porter-Silber test






Clinical Impact:



The administration of naproxen may result in increased urinary values for 17-ketogenic steroids because of an interaction between the drug and/or its metabolites with m-di-nitrobenzene used in this assay.





Intervention:



Although 17-hydroxy-corticosteroid measurements (Porter-Silber test) do not appear to be artifactually altered, it is suggested that therapy with naproxen be temporarily discontinued 72 hours before adrenal function tests are performed if the Porter-Silber test is to be used.





Urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA)






Clinical Impact:



Naproxen may interfere with some urinary assays of 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA).





Intervention:



This effect should be kept in mind when urinary 5-hydroxy indoleacetic acid is determined.











Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs):

   
Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking Naproxen Tablets with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of naproxen Tablets and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended.

See full prescribing information for drugs that affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to SYNTHROID. (7)








7.1 Drugs Known to Affect Thyroid Hormone Pharmacokinetics


Many drugs can exert effects on thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism (e.g., absorption, synthesis, secretion, catabolism, protein binding, and target tissue response) and may alter the therapeutic response to SYNTHROID (Tables 5 to 8). 

Table 5. Drugs That May Decrease T4 Absorption (Hypothyroidism)




Potential impact: Concurrent use may reduce the efficacy of SYNTHROID by binding and delaying or preventing absorption, potentially resulting in hypothyroidism. 



Drug or Drug Class


Effect



Phosphate Binders   (e.g., calcium carbonate, ferrous   sulfate, sevelamer, lanthanum) 
Phosphate binders may bind to levothyroxine. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours apart from these agents.


Orlistat
Monitor patients treated concomitantly with orlistat and SYNTHROID for changes in thyroid function.


Bile Acid Sequestrants   (e.g., colesevelam, cholestyramine,   colestipol)Ion Exchange Resins   (e.g., Kayexalate) 
Bile acid sequestrants and ion exchange resins are known to decrease levothyroxine absorption. Administer SYNTHROID at least 4 hours prior to these drugs or monitor TSH levels. 


Proton Pump InhibitorsSucralfateAntacids   (e.g., aluminum & magnesium   hydroxides, simethicone) 
Gastric acidity is an essential requirement for adequate absorption of levothyroxine. Sucralfate, antacids and proton pump inhibitors may cause hypochlorhydria, affect intragastric pH, and reduce levothyroxine absorption. Monitor patients appropriately. 




Table 6. Drugs That May Alter T4 and Triiodothyronine (T3) Serum Transport Without Affecting Free Thyroxine (FT4) Concentration (Euthyroidism) 





Drug or Drug Class 

Effect



ClofibrateEstrogen-containing oral contraceptivesEstrogens (oral)Heroin / Methadone5-FluorouracilMitotaneTamoxifen 
These drugs may increase serum thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) concentration.


Androgens / Anabolic SteroidsAsparaginaseGlucocorticoidsSlow-Release Nicotinic Acid 
These drugs may decrease serum TBG concentration.


Potential impact (below): Administration of these agents with SYNTHROID results in an initial transient increase in FT4. Continued administration results in a decrease in serum T4 and normal FT4 and TSH concentrations. 


Salicylates (> 2 g/day)
Salicylates inhibit binding of T4 and T3 to TBG and transthyretin. An initial increase in serum FT4 is followed by return of FT4 to normal levels with sustained therapeutic serum salicylate concentrations, although total T4 levels may decrease by as much as 30%. 


Other drugs:CarbamazepineFurosemide (> 80 mg IV)Heparin HydantoinsNon-Steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs- Fenamates 
These drugs may cause protein-binding site displacement. Furosemide has been shown to inhibit the protein binding of T4 to TBG and albumin, causing an increase free T4 fraction in serum. Furosemide competes for T4-binding sites on TBG, prealbumin, and albumin, so that a single high dose can acutely lower the total T4 level. Phenytoin and carbamazepine reduce serum protein binding of levothyroxine, and total and free T4 may be reduced by 20% to 40%, but most patients have normal serum TSH levels and are clinically euthyroid. Closely monitor thyroid hormone parameters. 




Table 7. Drugs That May Alter Hepatic Metabolism of T4 (Hypothyroidism)




Potential impact: Stimulation of hepatic microsomal drug-metabolizing enzyme activity may cause increased hepatic degradation of levothyroxine, resulting in increased SYNTHROID requirements. 



Drug or Drug Class


Effect



PhenobarbitalRifampin 
Phenobarbital has been shown to reduce the response to thyroxine. Phenobarbital increases L-thyroxine metabolism by inducing uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) and leads to lower T4 serum levels. Changes in thyroid status may occur if barbiturates are added or withdrawn from patients being treated for hypothyroidism. Rifampin has been shown to accelerate the metabolism of levothyroxine. 




Table 8. Drugs That May Decrease Conversion of T4 to T3




Potential impact: Administration of these enzyme inhibitors decreases the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3, leading to decreased T3 levels. However, serum T4 levels are usually normal but may occasionally be slightly increased. 



Drug or Drug Class


Effect



Beta-adrenergic antagonists(e.g., Propranolol > 160 mg/day) 
In patients treated with large doses of propranolol (> 160 mg/day), T3 and T4 levels change, TSH levels remain normal, and patients are clinically euthyroid. Actions of particular beta-adrenergic antagonists may be impaired when a hypothyroid patient is converted to the euthyroid state. 


Glucocorticoids(e.g., Dexamethasone > 4 mg/day) 
Short-term administration of large doses of glucocorticoids may decrease serum T3 concentrations by 30% with minimal change in serum T4 levels. However, long-term glucocorticoid therapy may result in slightly decreased T3 and T4 levels due to decreased TBG production (See above). 


Other drugs:Amiodarone 
Amiodarone inhibits peripheral conversion of levothyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause isolated biochemical changes (increase in serum free-T4, and decreased or normal free-T3) in clinically euthyroid patients. 












7.2 Antidiabetic Therapy


Addition of SYNTHROID therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus may worsen glycemic control and result in increased antidiabetic agent or insulin requirements. Carefully monitor glycemic control, especially when thyroid therapy is started, changed, or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions 
(

5.5

)
]. 









7.3 Oral Anticoagulants


SYNTHROID increases the response to oral anticoagulant therapy. Therefore, a decrease in the dose of anticoagulant may be warranted with correction of the hypothyroid state or when the SYNTHROID dose is increased. Closely monitor coagulation tests to permit appropriate and timely dosage adjustments. 









7.4 Digitalis Glycosides


SYNTHROID may reduce the therapeutic effects of digitalis glycosides. Serum digitalis glycoside levels may decrease when a hypothyroid patient becomes euthyroid, necessitating an increase in the dose of digitalis glycosides. 









7.5 Antidepressant Therapy 


Concurrent use of tricyclic (e.g., amitriptyline) or tetracyclic (e.g., maprotiline) antidepressants and SYNTHROID may increase the therapeutic and toxic effects of both drugs, possibly due to increased receptor sensitivity to catecholamines. Toxic effects may include increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias and central nervous system stimulation. SYNTHROID may accelerate the onset of action of tricyclics. Administration of sertraline in patients stabilized on SYNTHROID may result in increased SYNTHROID requirements. 









7.6 Ketamine


Concurrent use of ketamine and SYNTHROID may produce marked hypertension and tachycardia. Closely monitor blood pressure and heart rate in these patients. 









7.7 Sympathomimetics


Concurrent use of sympathomimetics and SYNTHROID may increase the effects of sympathomimetics or thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormones may increase the risk of coronary insufficiency when sympathomimetic agents are administered to patients with coronary artery disease. 









7.8 Tyrosine-Kinase Inhibitors 


Concurrent use of tyrosine-kinase inhibitors such as imatinib may cause hypothyroidism. Closely monitor TSH levels in such patients. 









7.9 Drug-Food Interactions


Consumption of certain foods may affect SYNTHROID absorption thereby necessitating adjustments in dosing [see Dosage and Administration 
(

2.1

)
]. Soybean flour, cottonseed meal, walnuts, and dietary fiber may bind and decrease the absorption of SYNTHROID from the gastrointestinal tract. Grapefruit juice may delay the absorption of levothyroxine and reduce its bioavailability. 









7.10 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions



Thyroxine-binding Globulin (TBG)

Consider changes in TBG concentration when interpreting T4 and T3 values. Measure and evaluate unbound (free) hormone and/or determine the free-T4 index (FT4I) in this circumstance. Pregnancy, infectious hepatitis, estrogens, estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, and acute intermittent porphyria increase TBG concentration. Nephrosis, severe hypoproteinemia, severe liver disease, acromegaly, androgens, and corticosteroids decrease TBG concentration. Familial hyper- or hypo-thyroxine binding globulinemias have been described, with the incidence of TBG deficiency approximating 1 in 9000.

MAOIs

MAOIs should not be used within 14 days of trazodone
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.8)].
 
  


Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants

Trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants.

Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors


In vitrodrug metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug interactions when trazodone is given with cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors. The effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The C
 
  maxof trazodone increased by 34%, the AUC increased 2.4 fold, the half-life increased by 2.2 fold, and the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were coadministered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole may lead to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations with the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of cardiac arrhythmia may be increased
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.4)]
 
  and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.

 

Cytochrome P450 Inducers (e.g., Carbamazepine)

Carbamazepine induces CYP3A4. Following coadministration of carbamazepine 400 mg per day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily, carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone and m-chlorophenlypiperazine (an active metabolite) by 76% and 60% respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine values. Patients should be closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both drugs.

Digoxin and Phenytoin

Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported in patients receiving trazodone concurrently with either of these drugs. Monitor serum levels and adjust dosages as needed.

Serotonergic Drugs

Based on the mechanism of action of trazodone and the potential for serotonin syndrome, caution is advised when trazodone is coadministered with other drugs that may affect the neurotransmitter systems [
 
  see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.2)
 
  ].

 

NSAIDs, Aspirin, or Other Drugs Affecting Coagulation or Bleeding

Due to a possible association between serotonin modulating drugs and gastrointestinal bleeding, patients should be monitored for and cautioned about the potential risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of trazodone and NSAIDs, aspirin, or other drugs that affect coagulation or bleeding [s
 
  ee Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.7)
 
  ].

 

Warfarin

There have been reports of altered (either increased or decreased) prothrombin times in taking both warfarin and trazodone.







7.1 Drugs Having Clinically Important Interactions with Trazodone


Table 3 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Trazodone





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)




Clinical Impact: 
     

The concomitant use of MAOIs and serotonergic drugs including trazodone increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Trazodone is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue
    
     [see Contraindications (4), Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4), and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Examples: 
     

isocarboxazid, moclobemide, phenelzine, selegiline, tranylcypromine 
     




Other Serotonergic Drugs




Clinical Impact: 
     


The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs including trazodone and other serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during trazodone initiation. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of trazodone and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].




Examples: 
     


triptans, antidepressants (tricyclic and serotonin uptake inhibitors), fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, and St. John's Wort 
     




Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants




Clinical Impact: 
     


Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with trazodone may potentiate the risk of bleeding. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding with the concomitant use of trazodone and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio (INR) when initiating or discontinuing trazodone
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].




Examples: 
     

warfarin, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, clopidogrel 
     




Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors




Clinical Impact: 
     

The concomitant use of trazodone and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increased the exposure of trazodone compared to the use of trazodone alone
    
     .




Intervention: 
     


If trazodone is used with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, the risk of adverse reactions, including cardiac arrhythmias, may be increased and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered
    
     [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].




Examples: 
     

itraconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir 
     




Strong CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact: 
     


The concomitant use of trazodone and strong CYP3A4 inducers decreased the exposure of trazodone compared to the use of trazodone alone
    
     .




Intervention: 
     


Patients should be closely monitored to see if there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking CYP3A4 inducers
    
     [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].




Examples: 
     

rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort 
     




Digoxin and Phenytoin




Clinical Impact: 
     


Digoxin and phenytoin are narrow therapeutic index drugs. Concomitant use of trazodone can increase digoxin or phenytoin concentrations. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Measure serum digoxin or phenytoin concentrations before initiating concomitant use of trazodone. Continue monitoring and reduce digoxin or phenytoin dose as necessary. 
     



Examples: 
     

digoxin, phenytoin 
     




Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants




Clinical Impact: 
     

Trazodone may enhance the response CNS depressants. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Patients should be counseled that trazodone may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and other CNS depressants. 
     



Examples: 
     

alcohol, barbiturates 
     




QT Interval Prolongation




Clinical Impact: 
     


Concomitant use of drugs that prolong the QT interval may add to the QT effects of trazodone and increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmia. 
     



Intervention: 
     


Avoid the use of trazodone in combination with other drugs known to prolong QTc
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. 
     



Examples: 
     


Class 1A antiarrhythmics: quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide; Class 3 antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, sotalol;

Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected.

Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes.

7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction

Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation.

7.1 Effect of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs


When administered intravenously, fosaprepitant, a prodrug of aprepitant, is converted to aprepitant within 30 minutes. Therefore, drug interactions following administration of fosaprepitant for injection are likely to occur with drugs that interact with oral aprepitant.

Fosaprepitant, given as a single 150-mg dose, is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and the weak inhibition of CYP3A4 continues for 2 days after single dose administration. Single dose fosaprepitant does not induce CYP3A4. Aprepitant is a substrate, an inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with fosaprepitant [see Contraindications (4)]. Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted, as shown in Table 7.


Table 7 Effects of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs






CYP3A4 Substrates




Pimozide




Clinical Impact

Increased pimozide exposure




Intervention

Fosaprepitant is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].




Benzodiazepines




Clinical Impact

Increased exposure to midazolam or other benzodiazepines metabolized via CYP3A4 (alprazolam, triazolam) may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

Monitor for benzodiazepine-related adverse reactions.




Dexamethasone




Clinical Impact

Increased dexamethasone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

Reduce the dose of oral dexamethasone by approximately 50% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].




Methylprednisolone




Clinical Impact

Increased methylprednisolone exposure [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

Reduce the dose of oral methylprednisolone by approximately 50% on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC.Reduce the dose of intravenous methylprednisolone by 25% on Days 1 and 2 for patients receiving HEC and on Day 1 for patients receiving MEC.




Chemotherapeutic agents that are metabolized by CYP3A4




Clinical Impact

Increased exposure of the chemotherapeutic agent may increase the risk of adverse reactions [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention


Vinblastine, vincristine, or ifosfamide or other chemotherapeutic agents


Monitor for chemotherapeutic-related adverse reactions.


Etoposide, vinorelbine, paclitaxel, and docetaxel

No dosage adjustment needed.






Hormonal Contraceptives




Clinical Impact

Decreased hormonal exposure during administration of and for 28 days after administration of the last dose of fosaprepitant [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Use in Specific Populations (8.3), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

Effective alternative or back-up methods of contraception (such as condoms and spermicides) should be used during treatment with fosaprepitant and for 1 month following administration of fosaprepitant.




Examples

birth control pills, skin patches, implants, and certain IUDs




CYP2C9 Substrates




Warfarin




Clinical Impact

Decreased warfarin exposure and decreased prothrombin time (INR) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

In patients on chronic warfarin therapy, monitor the prothrombin time (INR) in the 2-week period, particularly at 7 to 10 days, following administration of fosaprepitant with each chemotherapy cycle.

7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant


Aprepitant is a CYP3A4 substrate [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Co-administration of fosaprepitant with drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 may result in increased or decreased plasma concentrations of aprepitant, respectively, as shown in Table 8.


Table 8 Effects of Other Drugs on Pharmacokinetics of Fosaprepitant/Aprepitant






Moderate to Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors




Clinical Impact

Significantly increased exposure of aprepitant may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with fosaprepitant [see Adverse Reactions (6.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].




Intervention

Avoid concomitant use of fosaprepitant




Examples


Moderate inhibitor: diltiazem

Strong inhibitors:
ketoconazole, itraconazole, nefazodone, troleandomycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, nelfinavir




Strong CYP3A4 Inducers

If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.








7.2 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving olmesartan medoxomil and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including olmesartan medoxomil, may be attenuated by NSAIDs including selective COX-2 inhibitors.








7.3 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on olmesartan medoxomil and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not co-administer aliskiren with olmesartan medoxomil tablets in patients with diabetes

Prazosin hydrochloride has been administered without any adverse drug interaction in limited clinical experience to date with the following: (1) cardiac glycosides-digitalis and digoxin; (2) hypoglycemics-insulin, chlorpropamide, phenformin, tolazamide, and tolbutamide; (3) tranquilizers and sedatives-chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, and phenobarbital; (4) antigout-allopurinol, colchicine, and probenecid; (5) antiarrhythmics-procainamide, propranolol (see WARNINGS however), and quinidine; and (6) analgesics, antipyretics and anti-inflammatories-propoxyphene, aspirin, indomethacin, and phenylbutazone.

Addition of a diuretic or other antihypertensive agent to prazosin hydrochloride has been shown to cause an additive hypotensive effect. This effect can be minimized by reducing the prazosin hydrochloride dose to 1 mg to 2 mg three times a day, by introducing additional antihypertensive drugs cautiously, and then by retitrating prazosin hydrochloride based on clinical response.

ACE-Inhibitors


Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of ACE-inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE-inhibitors.









Aspirin


When nabumetone tablets are administered with aspirin, its protein binding is reduced, although the clearance of free nabumetone is not altered. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of nabumetone tablets and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential of increased adverse effects.









Diuretics

Clinical studies, as well as postmarketing observations, have shown that nabumetone tablets can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see 
WARNINGS

,

 Renal Effects
), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. 








Lithium


NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity.









Methotrexate


NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate.









Warfarin

The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.


In vitro studies have shown that, because of its affinity for protein, 6MNA may displace other protein-bound drugs from their binding site. Caution should be exercised when administering nabumetone tablets with warfarin since interactions have been seen with other NSAIDs.

Concomitant administration of an aluminum-containing antacid had no significant effect on the bioavailability of 6MNA. When administered with food or milk, there is more rapid absorption; however, the total amount of 6MNA in the plasma is unchanged (see

In evaluating individual cases, consideration should be given to using lower initial doses of the concomitantly administered drugs, using conservative titration schedules, and monitoring of clinical status
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








7.3 Other Serotonergic Drugs

The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) with fluoxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of fluoxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
 
  









7.4 Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g., NSAIDS, Aspirin, Warfarin)


Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Epidemiological studies of the case-control and cohort design that have demonstrated an association between use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding have also shown that concurrent use of an NSAID or aspirin may potentiate this risk of bleeding. Altered anticoagulant effects, including increased bleeding, have been reported when SNRIs or SSRIs are coadministered with warfarin. Patients receiving warfarin therapy should be carefully monitored when fluoxetine is initiated or discontinued
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]
 
  .

 








7.5 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)


There are no clinical studies establishing the benefit of the combined use of ECT and fluoxetine. There have been rare reports of prolonged seizures in patients on fluoxetine receiving ECT treatment.








7.6 Potential for Other Drugs to affect Fluoxetine



Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins —Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma proteins, adverse effects may result from displacement of protein-bound fluoxetine by other tightly-bound drugs
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








7.7 Potential for Fluoxetine to affect Other Drugs



Pimozide
—Concomitant use in patients taking pimozide is contraindicated. Pimozide can prolong the QT interval. Fluoxetine can increase the level of pimozide through inhibition of CYP2D6. Fluoxetine can also prolong the QT interval. Clinical studies of pimozide with other antidepressants demonstrate an increase in drug interaction or QT prolongation. While a specific study with pimozide and fluoxetine has not been conducted, the potential for drug interactions or QT prolongation warrants restricting the concurrent use of pimozide and fluoxetine
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4.2),
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and
  
   Drug Interactions (7.8)]
 
  .
 
  

  Thioridazine —
  Thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued, because of the risk of QT Prolongation
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4.2),
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.11), and
  
   Drug Interactions (7.8)]
 
  . 
  
  In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C
 
  maxand a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared with the rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of CYP2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs which inhibit CYP2D6, such as certain SSRIs, including fluoxetine, will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. 
  
  Thioridazine administration produces a dose-related prolongation of the QT interval, which is associated with serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as Torsades de Pointes-type arrhythmias, and sudden death. This risk is expected to increase with fluoxetine-induced inhibition of thioridazine metabolism.
 
  


  Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 —
    Fluoxetine inhibits the activity of CYP2D6, and may make individuals with normal CYP2D6 metabolic activity resemble a poor metabolizer. Coadministration of fluoxetine with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6, including certain antidepressants (e.g., TCAs), antipsychotics (e.g., phenothiazines and most atypicals), and antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide, and others) should be approached with caution. Therapy with medications that are predominantly metabolized by the CYP2D6 system and that have a relatively narrow therapeutic index (see list below) should be initiated at the low end of the dose range if a patient is receiving fluoxetine concurrently or has taken it in the previous 5 weeks. Thus, his/her dosing requirements resemble those of poor metabolizers. If fluoxetine is added to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug metabolized by CYP2D6, the need for decreased dose of the original medication should be considered. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic index represent the greatest concern (e.g., flecainide, propafenone, vinblastine, and TCAs). Due to the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias and sudden death potentially associated with elevated plasma levels of thioridazine, thioridazine should not be administered with fluoxetine or within a minimum of 5 weeks after fluoxetine has been discontinued
 
  [see
  
   Contraindications (4.2)]
 
  . 
 
  



  Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)
  
—In 2 studies, previously stable plasma levels of imipramine and desipramine have increased greater than 2- to 10-fold when fluoxetine has been administered in combination. This influence may persist for 3 weeks or longer after fluoxetine is discontinued. Thus, the dose of TCAs may need to be reduced and plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored temporarily when fluoxetine is coadministered or has been recently discontinued
 
  
[see 
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)and
   
    Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
  
   . 
   
  Benzodiazepines
 
  
—The half-life of concurrently administered diazepam may be prolonged in some patients
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  . Coadministration of alprazolam and fluoxetine has resulted in increased alprazolam plasma concentrations and in further psychomotor performance decrement due to increased alprazolam levels.
 
  



  Antipsychotics —
  Some clinical data suggests a possible pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic interaction between SSRIs and antipsychotics. Elevation of blood levels of haloperidol and clozapine has been observed in patients receiving concomitant fluoxetine.
 
  

  Anticonvulsants  —
    Patients on stable doses of phenytoin and carbamazepine have developed elevated plasma anticonvulsant concentrations and clinical anticonvulsant toxicity following initiation of concomitant fluoxetine treatment.
 
  



Lithium —There have been reports of both increased and decreased lithium levels when lithium was used concomitantly with fluoxetine. Cases of lithium toxicity and increased serotonergic effects have been reported. Lithium levels should be monitored when these drugs are administered concomitantly
 
   
  
   [see
   
    Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
  
   

.


  Drugs Tightly Bound to Plasma Proteins 
  
—Because fluoxetine is tightly bound to plasma proteins, the administration of fluoxetine to a patient taking another drug that is tightly bound to protein (e.g., Coumadin, digitoxin) may cause a shift in plasma concentrations potentially resulting in an adverse effect 
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .
 
  

  Drugs Metabolized by CYP3A4
  
—In an
 
  in vivointeraction study involving coadministration of fluoxetine with single doses of terfenadine (a CYP3A4 substrate), no increase in plasma terfenadine concentrations occurred with concomitant fluoxetine. 
  
  Additionally,
 
  in vitrostudies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than fluoxetine or norfluoxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including astemizole, cisapride, and midazolam. These data indicate that fluoxetine’s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not likely to be of clinical significance.
 
  

  Olanzapine
  
—Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended.
 
  

  When using fluoxetine and olanzapine and in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for
  
Symbyax.









7.8 Drugs that Prolong the QT Interval

Do not use fluoxetine in combination with thioridazine or pimozide. Use fluoxetine with caution in combination with other drugs that cause QT prolongation. These include: specific antipsychotics (e.g., ziprasidone, iloperidone, chlorpromazine, mesoridazine, droperidol); specific antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin, gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, sparfloxacin); Class 1A antiarrhythmic medications (e.g., quinidine, procainamide); Class III antiarrhythmics (e.g., amiodarone, sotalol); and others (e.g., pentamidine, levomethadyl acetate, methadone, halofantrine, mefloquine, dolasetron mesylate, probucol or tacrolimus). Fluoxetine is primarily metabolized by CYP2D6. Concomitant treatment with CYP2D6 inhibitors can increase the concentration of fluoxetine. Concomitant use of other highly protein-bound drugs can increase the concentration of
 
  fluoxetine

7.2 Pharmacodynamic-related Interactions



Centrally-Acting Drugs and Alcohol


Given the primary CNS effects of risperidone, caution should be used when risperidone is taken in combination with other centrally-acting drugs and alcohol.


Drugs with Hypotensive Effects


Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, risperidone may enhance the hypotensive effects of other therapeutic agents with this potential.


Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists


Risperidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.


Methylphenidate


Concomitant use with methylphenidate, when there is change in dosage of either medication, may increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Monitor for symptoms of EPS with concomitant use of risperidone and methylphenidate
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (
  
   6.2)].

7.1 Drugs
Prolonging QT Interval and Other Arrhythmogenic Drugs

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets prolongs the QT interval. There may be an increased risk of inducing ventricular arrhythmias if hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are used concomitantly with other arrhythmogenic drugs. Therefore, hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets are not recommended in patients taking other drugs that have the potential to prolong the QT interval or are arrhythmogenic [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].









7.2 Insulin or
Other Antidiabetic Drugs

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets may enhance the effects of insulin and antidiabetic drugs, and consequently increase the hypoglycemic risk. Therefore, a decrease in dosage of insulin and other antidiabetic drugs may be necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10
)].








7.3 Drugs that
Lower the Seizure Threshold

Hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets can lower the seizure threshold. Coadministration of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets with other antimalarials known to lower the seizure threshold (e.g., mefloquine) may increase the risk of seizures.









7.4 Antiepileptics

The activity of antiepileptic drugs might be impaired if coadministered with hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets.









7.5 Methotrexate

Concomitant use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and methotrexate may increase the incidence of adverse reactions.









7.6 Cyclosporine

An increased plasma cyclosporin level was reported when cyclosporin and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets were coadministered. Monitor serum cyclosporine levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.









7.7 Digoxin

Concomitant hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets and digoxin therapy may result in increased serum digoxin levels. Monitor serum digoxin levels closely in patients receiving combined therapy.









7.8 Cimetidine

Concomitant use of cimetidine resulted in a 2-fold increase of exposure of chloroquine, which is structurally related to hydroxychloroquine. Interaction of cimetidine with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out. Avoid concomitant use of cimetidine.









7.9 Rifampicin

Lack of efficacy of hydroxychloroquine was reported when rifampicin was concomitantly administered. Avoid concomitant use of rifampicin.









7.10 Praziquantel

Chloroquine has been reported to reduce the bioavailability of praziquantel. Interaction of praziquantel with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.









7.11 Antacids and kaolin

Antacids and kaolin can reduce absorption of chloroquine; an interval of at least 4 hours between intake of these agents and chloroquine should be observed. Interaction of antacids and kaolin with hydroxychloroquine cannot be ruled out.

7.1 Drugs Having Clinically
Important Interactions with Desvenlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets



Table 8: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with 
Desvenlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets







Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOI) 





Clinical Impact 



The concomitant use of SSRIs and SNRIs including desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets with MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. 





Intervention 



Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets is contraindicated: 

With an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders or within 7 days of stopping treatment with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. 
Within 14 days of stopping an MAOI intended to treat psychiatric disorders. 
In a patient who is being treated with linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 







Examples 



selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue 




Other Serotonergic Drugs 





Clinical Impact 



Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets with other serotonergic drugs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. 





Intervention 



Monitor for symptoms of serotonin syndrome when desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets is used concomitantly with other drugs that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 






Examples 



other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort 




Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis 





Clinical Impact 



Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets with an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug may potentiate the risk of bleeding. This may be due to the effect of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets on the release of serotonin by platelets. 





Intervention 



Closely monitor for bleeding for patients receiving an antiplatelet or anticoagulant drug when desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets is initiated or discontinued [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. 





Examples 



NSAIDs, aspirin, and warfarin 




Drugs that are Primarily Metabolized by CYP2D6 





Clinical Impact 



Concomitant use of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets increases Cmax and AUC of a drug primarily metabolized by CYP2D6 which may increase the risk of toxicity of the CYP2D6 substrate drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 





Intervention 



Original dose should be taken when co-administered with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets 100 mg or lower. Reduce the dose of these drugs by up to one-half if co-administered with 400 mg of desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets. 





Examples 



desipramine, atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine 














7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important
Interactions with Desvenlafaxine Extended-Release Tablets


Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment is required for drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., midazolam), or for drugs that are metabolized by both CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 (e.g., tamoxifen, aripiprazole), when administered concomitantly with desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].










7.3 Alcohol


A clinical study has shown that desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets do not increase the impairment of mental and motor skills caused by ethanol. However, as with all CNS-active drugs, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol consumption while taking desvenlafaxine extended-release tablets.









7.4 Drug-Laboratory Test
Interactions


False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking desvenlafaxine. This is due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of desvenlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish desvenlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.","selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue, other SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, St. John's Wort, NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, desipramine, atomoxetine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, midazolam, tamoxifen, aripiprazole"

Coadministration of divalproex sodium increased Cmax and AUC of paliperidone by approximately 50%. Adjust dose of paliperidone extended-release tablets if necessary based on clinical assessment. (7.2)









7.1 Potential for Paliperidone to Affect Other Drugs


Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone [see Adverse Reactions (

6.1

, 

6.2

)], paliperidone should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists.
Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension, an additive effect may be observed when paliperidone is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.9

)].
Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. Therefore, paliperidone is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. Paliperidone is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties.
Paliperidone is a weak inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) at high concentrations. No in vivo data are available and the clinical relevance is unknown.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between lithium and paliperidone is unlikely.
In a drug interaction study, coadministration of paliperidone (12 mg once daily for 5 days) with divalproex sodium extended-release tablets (500 mg to 2,000 mg once daily) did not affect the steady-state pharmacokinetics (AUC24h and Cmax,ss) of valproate in 13 patients stabilized on valproate. In a clinical study, subjects on stable doses of valproate had comparable valproate average plasma concentrations when paliperidone 3 to 15 mg/day was added to their existing valproate treatment.









7.2 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Paliperidone


Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely. While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism, in vivo studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance. In vitro studies have shown that paliperidone is a P-gp substrate.
Coadministration of paliperidone 6 mg once daily with carbamazepine, a strong inducer of both CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), at 200 mg twice daily caused a decrease of approximately 37% in the mean steady-state Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. This decrease is caused, to a substantial degree, by a 35% increase in renal clearance of paliperidone. A minor decrease in the amount of drug excreted unchanged in the urine suggests that there was little effect on the CYP metabolism or bioavailability of paliperidone during carbamazepine coadministration. On initiation of carbamazepine, the dose of paliperidone should be re-evaluated and increased if necessary. Conversely, on discontinuation of carbamazepine, the dose of paliperidone should be re-evaluated and decreased if necessary.
Paliperidone is metabolized to a limited extent by CYP2D6 [see Clinical Pharmacology (

12.3

)]. In an interaction study in healthy subjects in which a single 3 mg dose of paliperidone was administered concomitantly with 20 mg per day of paroxetine (a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor), paliperidone exposures were on average 16% (90% CI: 4, 30) higher in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. Higher doses of paroxetine have not been studied. The clinical relevance is unknown.
Coadministration of a single dose of paliperidone 12 mg with divalproex sodium extended-release tablets (two 500 mg tablets once daily) resulted in an increase of approximately 50% in the Cmax and AUC of paliperidone. Dosage reduction for paliperidone should be considered when paliperidone is coadministered with valproate after clinical assessment.
Pharmacokinetic interaction between lithium and paliperidone is unlikely.","carbamazepine,divalproex sodium,levodopa,lithium,valproate,paroxetine"

7.1 Aluminum-Containing Antacid Preparations


The concomitant administration of deferasirox and aluminum-containing antacid preparations has not been formally studied. Although deferasirox has a lower affinity for aluminum than for iron, do not take deferasirox with aluminum-containing antacid preparations.









7.2 Agents Metabolized by CYP3A4


Deferasirox may induce CYP3A4 resulting in a decrease in CYP3A4 substrate concentration when these drugs are coadministered. Closely monitor patients for signs of reduced effectiveness when deferasirox is administered with drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 (e.g., alfentanil, aprepitant, budesonide, buspirone, conivaptan, cyclosporine, darifenacin, darunavir, dasatinib, dihydroergotamine, dronedarone, eletriptan, eplerenone, ergotamine, everolimus, felodipine, fentanyl, hormonal contraceptive agents, indinavir, fluticasone, lopinavir, lovastatin, lurasidone, maraviroc, midazolam, nisoldipine, pimozide, quetiapine, quinidine, saquinavir, sildenafil, simvastatin, sirolimus, tacrolimus, tolvaptan, tipranavir, triazolam, ticagrelor, and vardenafil)

Deferasirox inhibits CYP1A2 resulting in an increase in CYP1A2 substrate (e.g., alosetron, caffeine, duloxetine, melatonin, ramelteon, tacrine, theophylline, tizanidine) concentration when these drugs are coadministered. An increase in theophylline plasma concentrations could lead to clinically significant theophylline induced CNS or other adverse reactions. Avoid the concomitant use of theophylline or other CYP1A2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., tizanidine) with deferasirox. Monitor theophylline concentrations and consider theophylline dose modification if you must coadminister theophylline with deferasirox.

Rx only",DI,"DRUG INTERACTIONS

In one survey, 2.3% of patients taking labetalol hydrochloride in combination with tricyclic antidepressants experienced tremor as compared to 0.7% reported to occur with labetalol hydrochloride alone. The contribution of each of the treatments to this adverse reaction is unknown but the possibility of a drug interaction cannot be excluded.
Drugs possessing beta-blocking properties can blunt the bronchodilator effect of beta-receptor agonist drugs in patients with bronchospasm; therefore, doses greater than the normal anti-asthmatic dose of beta-agonist bronchodilator drugs may be required.
Cimetidine has been shown to increase the bioavailability of labetalol hydrochloride. Since this could be explained either by enhanced absorption or by an alteration of hepatic metabolism of labetalol hydrochloride, special care should be used in establishing the dose required for blood pressure control in such patients.
Synergism has been shown between halothane anesthesia and intravenously administered labetalol hydrochloride. During controlled hypotensive anesthesia using labetalol hydrochloride in association with halothane, high concentrations (3% or above) of halothane should not be used because the degree of hypotension will be increased and because of the possibility of a large reduction in cardiac output and an increase in central venous pressure. The anesthesiologist should be informed when a patient is receiving labetalol hydrochloride.
Labetalol hydrochloride blunts the reflex tachycardia produced by nitroglycerin without preventing its hypotensive effect. If labetalol hydrochloride is used with nitroglycerin in patients with angina pectoris, additional antihypertensive effects may occur.
Care should be taken if labetalol is used concomitantly with calcium antagonists of the verapamil type. 
Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.
Risk of Anaphylactic Reaction 
While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reaction to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge, either accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic. Such patients may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat allergic reaction.






Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

The presence of labetalol metabolites in the urine may result in falsely elevated levels of urinary catecholamines, metanephrine, normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) when measured by fluorimetric or photometric methods. In screening patients suspected of having a pheochromocytoma and being treated with labetalol hydrochloride, a specific method, such as a high performance liquid chromatographic assay with solid phase extraction (e.g. J. Chromatogr 385:241, 1987) should be employed in determining levels of catecholamines.
Labetalol hydrochloride has also been reported to produce a false-positive test for amphetamine when screening urine for the presence of drugs using the commercially available assay methods Toxi-LabA® (thin-layer chromatographic assay) and Emit-d.a.u. ®(radioenzymatic assay). When patients being treated with labetalol have a positive urine test for amphetamine using these techniques, confirmation should be made by using more specific methods, such as a gas chromatographic-mass spectrometer technique.








Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term oral dosing studies with labetalol hydrochloride for 18 months in mice and for 2 years in rats showed no evidence of carcinogenesis. Studies with labetalol hydrochloride using dominant lethal assays in rats and mice and exposing microorganisms according to modified Ames tests, showed no evidence of mutagenesis.








Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects


Pregnancy Category C


Teratogenic studies were performed with labetalol in rats and rabbits at oral doses up to approximately six and four times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. No reproducible evidence of fetal malformations was observed. Increased fetal resorptions were seen in both species at doses approximating the MRHD. A teratology study performed with labetalol in rabbits at intravenous doses up to 1.7 times the MRHD revealed no evidence of drug-related harm to the fetus. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Labetalol should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.
Nonteratogenic Effects
Hypotension, bradycardia, hypoglycemia and respiratory depression have been reported in infants of mothers who were treated with labetalol hydrochloride for hypertension during pregnancy. Oral administration of labetalol to rats during late gestation through weaning at doses of two to four times the MRHD caused a decrease in neonatal survival.








Labor and Delivery

Labetalol hydrochloride given to pregnant women with hypertension did not appear to affect the usual course of labor and delivery.








Nursing Mothers

Small amounts of labetalol (approximately 0.004% of the maternal dose) are excreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when labetalol hydrochloride tablets are administered to a nursing woman..








Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 








Elderly Patients

As in the general population, some elderly patients (60 years of age and older) have experienced orthostatic hypotension, dizziness or lightheadedness during treatment with labetalol. Because elderly patients are generally more likely than younger patients to experience orthostatic symptoms, they should be cautioned about the possibility of such side effects during treatment with labetalol.","tricyclic antidepressants, cimetidine, halothane, nitroglycerin, calcium antagonists, digitalis glycosides, epinephrine"

Clinical studies have not shown any drug interactions between bicalutamide and LHRH analogs (goserelin or leuprolide). There is no evidence that bicalutamide induces hepatic enzymes.

In vitrostudies have shown that R-bicalutamide is an inhibitor of CYP 3A4 with lesser inhibitory effects on CYP 2C9, 2C19 and 2D6 activity. Clinical studies have shown that with co-administration of bicalutamide, mean midazolam (a CYP 3A4 substrate) levels may be increased 1.5-fold (for C

Hormonal contraceptives: Bosentan use decreases contraceptive exposure and reduces effectiveness (7.2).







7.1 Cytochrome P450 Drug Interactions

Bosentan is metabolized by CYP2C9 and CYP3A. Inhibition of these enzymes may increase the plasma concentration of bosentan [see Pharmacokinetics (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of both a CYP2C9 inhibitor (such as fluconazole or amiodarone) and a strong CYP3A inhibitor (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole) or a moderate CYP3A inhibitor (e.g. amprenavir, erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem) with bosentan will likely lead to large increases in plasma concentrations of bosentan. Coadministration of such combinations of a CYP2C9 inhibitor plus a strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitor with bosentan is not recommended.
Bosentan is an inducer of CYP3A and CYP2C9. Consequently plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these two isozymes will be decreased when bosentan is coadministered. Bosentan had no relevant inhibitory effect on any CYP isozyme in vitro (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A). Consequently, bosentan is not expected to increase the plasma concentrations of drugs metabolized by these enzymes.

7.2 Hormonal Contraceptives

Hormonal contraceptives, including oral, injectable, transdermal, and implantable forms, may not be reliable when bosentan is coadministered. Females should practice additional methods of contraception and not rely on hormonal contraception alone when taking bosentan [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)].
An interaction study demonstrated that coadministration of bosentan and a combination oral hormonal contraceptive produced average decreases of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol levels of 14% and 31%, respectively. However, decreases in exposure were as much as 56% and 66%, respectively, in individual subjects.

Allopurinol

Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine's active metabolites [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may decrease efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of allopurinol with capecitabine. 

Leucovorin 

The concentration of fluorouracil is increased and its toxicity may be enhanced by leucovorin, folic acid, or folate analog products. Deaths from severe enterocolitis, diarrhea, and dehydration have been reported in elderly patients receiving weekly leucovorin and fluorouracil.
Instruct patients not to take products containing folic acid or folate analog products unless directed to do so by their healthcare provider.







7.2 Effect of Capecitabine on Other Drugs


CYP2C9 Substrates

Capecitabine increased exposure of CYP2C9 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates. Closely monitor for adverse reactions of CYP2C9 substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions when used concomitantly with capecitabine (e.g., anticoagulants, antidiabetic drugs).

Vitamin K Antagonists

Capecitabine increases exposure of vitamin K antagonist [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may alter coagulation parameters and/or bleeding and could result in death [see Warning and Precautions (5.1)]. These events may occur within days of treatment initiation and up to 1 month after discontinuation of capecitabine.
Monitor INR more frequently and refer to the prescribing information of oral vitamin K antagonist for dosage adjustment, as appropriate, when capecitabine is used concomitantly with vitamin K antagonist.

Moderate (e.g., ciprofloxacin) and strong inhibitors of CYP1A2 (e.g., fluvoxamine) increase systemic exposure of pirfenidone and may alter the adverse reaction profile of pirfenidone. Discontinue fluvoxamine prior to administration of pirfenidone or reduce to 267 mg three times a day. Consider dosage reduction with use of ciprofloxacin. (7.1)







7.1 CYP1A2 Inhibitors

Pirfenidone is metabolized primarily (70 to 80%) via CYP1A2 with minor contributions from other CYP isoenzymes including CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1.


Strong CYP1A2 Inhibitors

The concomitant administration of pirfenidone and fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., enoxacin) is not recommended because it significantly increases exposure to pirfenidone [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Use of fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors should be discontinued prior to administration of pirfenidone and avoided during pirfenidone treatment. In the event that fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors are the only drug of choice, dosage reductions are recommended. Monitor for adverse reactions and consider discontinuation of pirfenidone as needed [see

Concomitant administration of pirfenidone and ciprofloxacin (a moderate inhibitor of CYP1A2) moderately increases exposure to pirfenidone [see 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)
]. If ciprofloxacin at the dosage of 750 mg twice daily cannot be avoided, dosage reductions are recommended [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.4)
]. Monitor patients closely when ciprofloxacin is used at a dosage of 250 mg or 500 mg once daily.


Concomitant CYP1A2 and other CYP Inhibitors

Agents or combinations of agents that are moderate or strong inhibitors of both CYP1A2 and one or more other CYP isoenzymes involved in the metabolism of pirfenidone (i.e., CYP2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 2E1) should be discontinued prior to and avoided during pirfenidone treatment.








7.2 CYP1A2 Inducers

The concomitant use of pirfenidone and a CYP1A2 inducer may decrease the exposure of pirfenidone and this may lead to loss of efficacy. Therefore, discontinue use of strong CYP1A2 inducers prior to pirfenidone treatment and avoid the concomitant use of pirfenidone and a strong CYP1A2 inducer [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, enoxacin"

Table 3	Drug Interactions with MAVENCLAD






7.1 Immunomodulatory, Immunosuppressive, or Myelosuppressive Drugs





Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of MAVENCLAD with immunomodulatory, immunosuppressive, or myelosuppressive drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive effects on the immune system [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].



Prevention or Management

Concomitant use with myelosuppressive or other immunosuppressive drugs is not recommended. Acute short-term therapy with corticosteroids can be administered.In patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive drugs, consider potential additive effect, the mode of action, and duration of effect of the other drugs prior to initiation of MAVENCLAD.




7.2 Interferon-Beta





Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of MAVENCLAD with interferon-beta did not change the exposure of cladribine to a clinically significant effect; however, lymphopenia risk may be increased [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].




Prevention or Management

Concomitant use is not recommended.




7.3 Hematotoxic Drugs





Clinical Impact

Concomitant use of MAVENCLAD with hematotoxic drugs may increase the risk of adverse reactions because of the additive hematological effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].




Prevention or Management

Monitor hematological parameters.




7.4 Antiviral and Antiretroviral Drugs





Clinical Impact

Compounds that require intracellular phosphorylation to become active (e.g., lamivudine, zalcitabine, ribavirin, stavudine, and zidovudine) could interfere with the intracellular phosphorylation and activity of cladribine.



Prevention or Management

Avoid concomitant use.





7.5 Potent ENT, CNT and BCRP Transporter Inhibitors





Clinical Impact

Cladribine is a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), equilibrative nucleoside (ENT1), and concentrative nucleoside (CNT3) transport proteins. The bioavailability, intracellular distribution, and renal elimination of cladribine may be altered by potent ENT1, CNT3, and BCRP transporter inhibitors.



Prevention or Management

Avoid co-administration of potent ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, eltrombopag, curcumin, cyclosporine, dilazep, nifedipine, nimodipine, cilostazol, sulindac, dipyridamole, or reserpine) during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles. If this is not possible, consider selection of alternative concomitant drugs with no or minimal ENT1, CNT3, or BCRP transporter inhibiting properties. If this is not possible, dose reduction to the minimum mandatory dose of drugs containing these compounds, separation in the timing of administration, and careful patient monitoring is recommended.




7.6 Potent BCRP and P-gp Transporter Inducers





Clinical Impact

Possible decrease in cladribine exposure if potent BCRP or P-gp transporter inducers are co-administered.



Prevention or Management

Consider a possible decrease in cladribine efficacy if potent BCRP (e.g., corticosteroids) or P-gp (e.g., rifampicin, St. John's Wort) transporter inducers are co-administered.

Initial U.S. Approval: 1998",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


Effects of Modafinil on CYP3A4/5 Substrates

The clearance of drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4/5 (e.g., steroidal contraceptives, cyclosporine, midazolam, and triazolam) may be increased by modafinil via induction of metabolic enzymes, which results in lower systemic exposure.  Dosage adjustment of these drugs should be considered when these drugs are used concomitantly with modafinil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
The effectiveness of steroidal contraceptives may be reduced when used with modafinil and for one month after discontinuation of therapy.  Alternative or concomitant methods of contraception are recommended for patients taking steroidal contraceptives (e.g., ethinyl estradiol) when treated concomitantly with modafinil and for one month after discontinuation of modafinil treatment.
Blood levels of cyclosporine may be reduced when used with modafinil.  Monitoring of circulating cyclosporine concentrations and appropriate dosage adjustment for cyclosporine should be considered when used concomitantly with modafinil. 

Effects of Modafinil on CYP2C19 Substrates

Elimination of drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 (e.g., phenytoin, diazepam, propranolol, omeprazole, and clomipramine) may be prolonged by modafinil via inhibition of metabolic enzymes, with resultant higher systemic exposure.  In individuals deficient in the CYP2D6 enzyme, the levels of CYP2D6 substrates which have ancillary routes of elimination through CYP2C19, such as tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be increased by co-administration of modafinil.  Dose adjustments of these drugs and other drugs that are substrates for CYP2C19 may be necessary when used concomitantly with modafinil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 

Warfarin

More frequent monitoring of prothrombin times/INR should be considered whenever modafinil is coadministered with warfarin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Monoamine Oxidase (MAO) Inhibitors  

Caution should be used when concomitantly administering MAO inhibitors and modafinil.

Flecainide has been administered to patients receiving digitalis preparations or beta-adrenergic blocking agents without adverse effects. During administration of multiple oral doses of flecainide to healthy subjects stabilized on a maintenance dose of digoxin, a 13% to 19% increase in plasma digoxin levels occurred at six hours postdose.
In a study involving healthy subjects receiving flecainide and propranolol concurrently, plasma flecainide levels were increased about 20% and propranolol levels were increased about 30% compared to control values. In this formal interaction study, flecainide and propranolol were each found to have negative inotropic effects; when the drugs were administered together, the effects were additive. The effects of concomitant administration of flecainide and propranolol on the PR interval were less than additive. In flecainide clinical trials, patients who were receiving beta blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects. Nevertheless, the possibility of additive negative inotropic effects of beta blockers and flecainide should be recognized.
Flecainide is not extensively bound to plasma proteins.
 
  In vitrostudies with several drugs which may be administered concomitantly showed that the extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is either unchanged or only slightly less. Consequently, interactions with other drugs which are highly protein bound (e.g., anticoagulants) would not be expected. Flecainide has been used in a large number of patients receiving diuretics without apparent interaction. Limited data in patients receiving known enzyme inducers (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) indicate only a 30% increase in the rate of flecainide elimination. In healthy subjects receiving cimetidine (1 gm daily) for one week, plasma flecainide levels increased by about 30% and half-life increased by about 10%.

 
When amiodarone is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients, if flecainide dosage is not reduced. (
 
  See
  
   DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.
 
  )

 
Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy; especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.
There has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide are unknown, neither disopyramide nor verapamil should be administered concurrently with flecainide unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.","digitalis preparations, beta-adrenergic blocking agents, digoxin, propranolol, beta blockers, anticoagulants, diuretics, enzyme inducers, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, cimetidine, amiodarone, quinidine, disopyramide, verapamil, nifedipine, diltiazem"

7.1 Effect of Aprepitant on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs

Aprepitant is a substrate, a weak-to-moderate (dose-dependent) inhibitor, and an inducer of CYP3A4. Aprepitant is also an inducer of CYP2C9 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
Aprepitant acts as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 when administered as a 3-day regimen (125mg/80-mg/80-mg) and can increase plasma concentrations of concomitant drugs that are substrates for CYP3A4. Aprepitant acts as a weak inhibitor when administered as a single 40-mg dose and has not been shown to alter the plasma concentrations of concomitant drugs that are primarily metabolized through CYP3A4. Some substrates of CYP3A4 are contraindicated with aprepitant [see Contraindications (4)]. Dosage adjustment of some CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 substrates may be warranted, as shown in Table 10.

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA
 
  Asites and opioids interact primarily at mµ receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation. 
    If diazepam is to be combined with other psychotropic agents or anticonvulsant drugs, careful consideration should be given to the pharmacology of the agents to be employed, particularly with known compounds which may potentiate the action of diazepam, such as phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, and other antidepressants. In highly anxious patients with evidence of accompanying depression, particularly those who may have suicidal tendencies, protective measures may be necessary. 
    Diazepam injection has produced hypotension or muscular weakness in some patients particularly when used with narcotics, barbiturates, or alcohol. 
    The clearance of diazepam and certain other benzodiazepines can be delayed in association with cimetidine administration. The clinical significance of this is unclear.","benzodiazepines, opioids, phenothiazines, narcotics, barbiturates, MAO inhibitors, antidepressants, alcohol, cimetidine"

As with all drugs, the potential exists for interaction with other drugs by a variety of mechanisms.

CNS-Active Drugs:


Ethanol: Zaleplon 10 mg potentiated the CNS-impairing effects of ethanol 0.75 g/kg on balance testing and reaction time for 1 hour after ethanol administration and on the digit symbol substitution test (DSST), symbol copying test, and the variability component of the divided attention test for 2.5 hours after ethanol administration. The potentiation resulted from a CNS pharmacodynamic interaction; zaleplon did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ethanol.

Imipramine: Co-administration of single doses of zaleplon 20 mg and imipramine 75 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration. The interaction was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of either drug.

Paroxetine: Co-administration of a single dose of zaleplon 20 mg and paroxetine 20 mg daily for 7 days did not produce any interaction on psychomotor performance. Additionally, paroxetine did not alter the pharmacokinetics of zaleplon, reflecting the absence of a role of CYP2D6 in zaleplon’s metabolism.

Thioridazine: Co-administration of single doses of zaleplon 20 mg and thioridazine 50 mg produced additive effects on decreased alertness and impaired psychomotor performance for 2 to 4 hours after administration. The interaction was pharmacodynamic with no alteration of the pharmacokinetics of either drug.

Venlafaxine: Co-administration of a single dose of zaleplon 10 mg and multiple doses of venlafaxine ER (extended release) 150 mg did not result in any significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of either zaleplon or venlafaxine. In addition, there was no pharmacodynamic interaction as a result of co-administration of zaleplon and venlafaxine ER.

Promethazine: Co-administration of a single dose of zaleplon and promethazine (10 and 25 mg, respectively) resulted in a 15% decrease in maximal plasma concentrations of zaleplon, but no change in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. However, the pharmacodynamics of co-administration of zaleplon and promethazine have not been evaluated. Caution should be exercised when these 2 agents are co-administered.

Drugs That Induce CYP3A4:


Rifampin: CYP3A4 is ordinarily a minor metabolizing enzyme of zaleplon. Multiple-dose administration of the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampin (600 mg every 24 hours, q24h, for 14 days), however, reduced zaleplon Cmax and AUC by approximately 80%. The co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 enzyme inducer, although not posing a safety concern, thus could lead to ineffectiveness of zaleplon. An alternative non-CYP3A4 substrate hypnotic agent may be considered in patients taking CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital.

Drugs That Inhibit CYP3A4:

CYP3A4 is a minor metabolic pathway for the elimination of zaleplon because the sum of desethylzaleplon (formed via CYP3A4 in vitro) and its metabolites, 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon and 5-oxo-desethylzaleplon glucuronide, accounts for only 9% of the urinary recovery of a zaleplon dose. Co-administration of single, oral doses of zaleplon with erythromycin (10 mg and 800 mg, respectively), a strong, selective CYP3A4 inhibitor, produced a 34% increase in zaleplon's maximal plasma concentrations and a 20% increase in the area under the plasma concentration time curve. The magnitude of interaction with multiple doses of erythromycin is unknown. Other strong selective CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole can also be expected to increase the exposure of zaleplon. A routine dosage adjustment of zaleplon is not considered necessary.

Drugs That Inhibit Aldehyde Oxidase:

The aldehyde oxidase enzyme system is less well studied than the cytochrome P450 enzyme system.

Diphenhydramine: Diphenhydramine is reported to be a weak inhibitor of aldehyde oxidase in rat liver, but its inhibitory effects in human liver are not known. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction between zaleplon and diphenhydramine following the administration of a single dose (10 mg and 50 mg, respectively) of each drug. However, because both of these compounds have CNS effects, an additive pharmacodynamic effect is possible.

Drugs That Inhibit Both Aldehyde Oxidase and CYP3A4:


Cimetidine: Cimetidine inhibits both aldehyde oxidase (in vitro) and CYP3A4 (in vitro and in vivo), the primary and secondary enzymes, respectively, responsible for zaleplon metabolism. Concomitant administration of zaleplon (10 mg) and cimetidine (800 mg) produced an 85% increase in the mean Cmax and AUC of zaleplon. An initial dose of 5 mg should be given to patients who are concomitantly being treated with cimetidine (see 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).

Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein:

Zaleplon is not highly bound to plasma proteins (fraction bound 60%±15%); therefore, the disposition of zaleplon is not expected to be sensitive to alterations in protein binding. In addition, administration of zaleplon to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound should not cause transient increase in free concentrations of the other drug.

Drugs with a Narrow Therapeutic Index:


Digoxin: Zaleplon (10 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profile of digoxin (0.375 mg q24h for 8 days).

Warfarin: Multiple oral doses of zaleplon (20 mg q24h for 13 days) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin (R+)- or (S-)-enantiomers or the pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time) following a single 25 mg oral dose of warfarin.

Drugs That Alter Renal Excretion:


Ibuprofen: Ibuprofen is known to affect renal function and, consequently, alter the renal excretion of other drugs.

7.1 Drugs Causing Central Nervous System (CNS) Adverse Reactions

The concurrent use of scopolamine transdermal system with other drugs that cause CNS adverse reactions of drowsiness, dizziness or disorientation (e.g., sedatives, hypnotics, opiates, anxiolytics and alcohol) or have anticholinergic properties (e.g., other belladonna alkaloids, sedating antihistamines, meclizine, tricyclic antidepressants, and muscle relaxants) may potentiate the effects of scopolamine transdermal system     [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.2)]     . Either scopolamine transdermal system or the interacting drug should be chosen, depending on the importance of the drug to the patient. If the interacting drug cannot be avoided, monitor patients for CNS adverse reactions.   








7.2 Anticholinergic Drugs

Concomitant use of scopolamine with other drugs having anticholinergic properties may increase the risk of CNS adverse reactions     [see Drug Interactions (       7.1)],     intestinal obstruction and/or urinary retention. Consider more frequent monitoring during treatment with scopolamine transdermal system in patients receiving anticholinergic drugs     [see Warnings and Precautions (       5.2,       5.4)]     .   








7.3 Oral Drugs Absorbed in the Stomach

Scopolamine transdermal system, as an anticholinergic, may delay gastric and upper gastrointestinal motility and, therefore, the rate of absorption of other orally administered drugs. Monitor patients for modified therapeutic effect of concomitant orally administered drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.

7.1 Coumarin Anticoagulants

Potentiation of coumarin-type anticoagulant effects has been observed with prolongation of the PT/INR.
Caution should be exercised when coumarin anticoagulants are given in conjunction with fenofibrate tablets. The dosage of the anticoagulants should be reduced to maintain the PT/INR at the desired level to prevent bleeding complications. Frequent PT/INR determinations are advisable until it has been definitely determined that the PT/INR has stabilized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].









7.2 Immunosuppressants

Immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus can produce nephrotoxicity with decreases in creatinine clearance and rises in serum creatinine, and because renal excretion is the primary elimination route of fibrate drugs including fenofibrate tablets, there is a risk that an interaction will lead to deterioration of renal function. The benefits and risks of using fenofibrate tablets with immunosuppressants and other potentially nephrotoxic agents should be carefully considered, and the lowest effective dose employed and renal function monitored.








7.3 Bile Acid Binding Resins

Since bile acid binding resins may bind other drugs given concurrently, patients should take fenofibrate tablets at least 1 hour before or 4 to 6 hours after a bile acid binding resin to avoid impeding their absorption.

During the concomitant use of a drug that may exhibit additive or synergistic renal impairment with cyclosporine, close monitoring of renal function (in particular serum creatinine) should be performed. If a significant impairment of renal function occurs, the dosage of the coadministered drug should be reduced or an alternative treatment considered. 
Cyclosporine is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A isoenzymes, in particular CYP3A4, and is a substrate of the multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein. Various agents are known to either increase or decrease plasma or whole blood concentrations of cyclosporine usually by inhibition or induction of CYP3A4 or P-glycoprotein transporter or both. Compounds that decrease cyclosporine absorption such as orlistat should be avoided. Appropriate Gengraf® dosage adjustment to achieve the desired cyclosporine concentrations is essential when drugs that significantly alter cyclosporine concentrations are used concomitantly. (See

The HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir) are known to inhibit cytochrome P-450 3A and thus could potentially increase the concentrations of cyclosporine, however no formal studies of the interaction are available. Care should be exercised when these drugs are administered concomitantly.

Bosentan 
Coadministration of bosentan (250 to 1000 mg every 12 hours based on tolerability) and cyclosporine (300 mg every 12 hours for 2 days then dosing to achieve a Cmin of 200 to 250 ng/mL) for 7 days in healthy subjects resulted in decreases in the cyclosporine mean dose-normalized AUC, Cmax, and trough concentration of approximately 50%, 30%, and 60%, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone (See also 
Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents
). Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. 
Boceprevir 
Coadministration of boceprevir (800 mg three times daily for 7 days) and cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean AUC and Cmax of cyclosporine approximately 2.7-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine was given alone. 
Telaprevir 
Coadministration of telaprevir (750 mg every 8 hours for 11 days) with cyclosporine (10 mg on day 8) in healthy subjects resulted in increases in the mean dose-normalized AUC and Cmax of cyclosporine approximately 4.5-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, compared to when cyclosporine (100 mg single dose) was given alone. 
St. John's Wort 
There have been reports of a serious drug interaction between cyclosporine and the herbal dietary supplement St. John's Wort. This interaction has been reported to produce a marked reduction in the blood concentrations of cyclosporine, resulting in subtherapeutic levels, rejection of transplanted organs, and graft loss. 
Rifabutin 
Rifabutin is known to increase the metabolism of other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P-450 system. The interaction between rifabutin and cyclosporine has not been studied. Care should be exercised when these two drugs are administered concomitantly. 









B. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety of Other Drugs or Agents


Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and of multiple drug efflux transporters (e.g., P-glycoprotein) and may increase plasma concentrations of comedications that are substrates of CYP3A4, P-glycoprotein or organic anion transporter proteins. 
Cyclosporine may reduce the clearance of digoxin, colchicine, prednisolone, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and, aliskiren, bosentan, dabigatran, repaglinide, NSAIDs, sirolimus, etoposide, and other drugs. 

See the full prescribing information of the other drug for further information and specific recommendations. The decision on coadministration of cyclosporine with other drugs or agents should be made by the healthcare provider following the careful assessment of benefits and risks.

Digoxin 
Severe digitalis toxicity has been seen within days of starting cyclosporine in several patients taking digoxin. If digoxin is used concurrently with cyclosporine, serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored. 
Colchicine 
There are reports on the potential of cyclosporine to enhance the toxic effects of colchicine such as myopathy and neuropathy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Concomitant administration of cyclosporine and colchicine results in significant increases in colchicine plasma concentrations. If colchicine is used concurrently with cyclosporine, a reduction in the dosage of colchicine is recommended. 
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) 
Literature and postmarketing cases of myotoxicity, including muscle pain and weakness, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis, have been reported with concomitant administration of cyclosporine with lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, pravastatin, and, rarely fluvastatin. When concurrently administered with cyclosporine, the dosage of these statins should be reduced according to label recommendations. Statin therapy needs to be temporarily withheld or discontinued in patients with signs and symptoms of myopathy or those with risk factors predisposing to severe renal injury, including renal failure, secondary to rhabdomyolysis. 
Repaglinide 
Cyclosporine may increase the plasma concentrations of repaglinide and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia. In 12 healthy male subjects who received two doses of 100 mg cyclosporine capsule orally 12 hours apart with a single dose of 0.25 mg repaglinide tablet (one-half of a 0.5mg tablet) orally 13 hours after the cyclosporine initial dose, the repaglinide mean Cmax and AUC were increased 1.8 fold (range: 0.6 to 3.7 fold) and 2.4 fold (range 1.2 to 5.3 fold), respectively. Close monitoring of blood glucose level is advisable for a patient taking cyclosporine and repaglinide concomitantly. 
Ambrisentan 
Coadministration of ambrisentan (5 mg daily) and cyclosporine (100 to 150 mg twice daily initially, then dosing to achieve Cmin 150 to 200 ng/mL) for 8 days in healthy subjects resulted in mean increases in ambrisentan AUC and Cmax of approximately 2-fold and 1.5-fold, respectively, compared to ambrisentan alone. When coadministering ambrisentan with cyclosporine, the ambrisentan dose should not be titrated to the recommended maximum daily dose. 
Anthracycline antibiotics 
High doses of cyclosporine (e.g., at starting intravenous dose of 16 mg/kg/day) may increase the exposure to anthracycline antibiotics (e.g., doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, daunorubicin) in cancer patients. 
Aliskiren 
Cyclosporine alters the pharmacokinetics of aliskiren, a substrate of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4. In 14 healthy subjects who received concomitantly single doses of cyclosporine (200 mg) and reduced dose aliskiren (75 mg), the mean Cmax of aliskiren was increased by approximately 2.5-fold (90% CI: 1.96 to 3.17) and the mean AUC by approximately 4.3 fold (90% CI: 3.52 to 5.21), compared to when these subjects received aliskiren alone. The concomitant administration of aliskiren with cyclosporine prolonged the median aliskiren elimination half-life (26 hours versus 43 to 45 hours) and the Tmax (0.5 hours versus 1.5 to 2.0 hours). The mean AUC and Cmax of cyclosporine were comparable to reported literature values. Coadministration of cyclosporine and aliskiren in these subjects also resulted in an increase in the number and/or intensity of adverse events, mainly headache, hot flush, nausea, vomiting, and somnolence. The coadministration of cyclosporine with aliskiren is not recommended. 
Bosentan 
In healthy subjects, coadministration of bosentan and cyclosporine resulted in time-dependent mean increases in dose-normalized bosentan trough concentrations (i.e., approximately 21-fold on day 1 and 2-fold on day 8 (steady state)) compared to when bosentan was given alone as a single dose on day 1. (See also 
Effect of Drugs and Other Agents on Cyclosporine Pharmacokinetics and/or Safety
) Coadministration of cyclosporine with bosentan should be avoided. 
Dabigatran 
The effect of cyclosporine on dabigatran concentrations had not been formally studied. Concomitant administration of dabigatran and cyclosporine may result in increased plasma dabigatran concentrations due to the P-gp inhibitory activity of cyclosporine. Coadministration of cyclosporine with dabigatran should be avoided. 
Potassium-Sparing Diuretics 
Cyclosporine should not be used with potassium-sparing diuretics because hyperkalemia can occur. Caution is also required when cyclosporine is coadministered with potassium sparing drugs (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists), potassium-containing drugs as well as in patients on a potassium rich diet. Control of potassium levels in these situations is advisable. 
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug (NSAID) Interactions 
Clinical status and serum creatinine should be closely monitored when cyclosporine is used with NSAIDs in rheumatoid arthritis patients. (See 
WARNINGS
) 
Pharmacodynamic interactions have been reported to occur between cyclosporine and both naproxen and sulindac, in that concomitant use is associated with additive decreases in renal function, as determined by 99mTc-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and (p-aminohippuric acid) PAH clearances. Although concomitant administration of diclofenac does not affect blood concentrations of cyclosporine, it has been associated with approximate doubling of diclofenac blood concentrations and occasional reports of reversible decreases in renal function. Consequently, the dose of diclofenac should be in the lower end of the therapeutic range. 
Methotrexate Interaction 
Preliminary data indicate that when methotrexate and cyclosporine were coadministered to rheumatoid arthritis patients (N=20), methotrexate concentrations (AUCs) were increased approximately 30% and the concentrations (AUCs) of its metabolite, 7-hydroxy methotrexate, were decreased by approximately 80%. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known. Cyclosporine concentrations do not appear to have been altered (N=6). 
Sirolimus 
Elevations in serum creatinine were observed in studies using sirolimus in combination with full-dose cyclosporine. This effect is often reversible with cyclosporine dose reduction. Simultaneous coadministration of cyclosporine significantly increases blood levels of sirolimus. To minimize increases in sirolimus concentrations, it is recommended that sirolimus be given 4 hours after cyclosporine administration. 
Nifedipine 
Frequent gingival hyperplasia when nifedipine is given concurrently with cyclosporine has been reported. The concomitant use of nifedipine should be avoided in patients in whom gingival hyperplasia develops as a side effect of cyclosporine. 
Methylprednisolone 
Convulsions when high dose methylprednisolone is given concurrently with cyclosporine have been reported. 
Other Immunosuppressive Drugs and Agents 
Psoriasis patients receiving other immunosuppressive agents or radiation therapy (including PUVA and UVB) should not receive concurrent cyclosporine because of the possibility of excessive immunosuppression. 

C. Effect of Cyclosporine on the Efficacy of Live Vaccines 

During treatment with cyclosporine, vaccination may be less effective. The use of live vaccines should be avoided.

There are no known drug-drug interactions. Although, fulvestrant is metabolized by CYP 3A4 in vitro, drug interactions studies with ketoconazole or rifampin did not alter fulvestrant pharmacokinetics.

Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents.

Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness.


In vitrostudies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4.","neuromuscular blocking agents, rifampicin"

7.1 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of losartan with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients. 








7.2 Lithium

Increases in serum lithium concentrations and lithium toxicity have been reported during concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin II receptor antagonists. Monitor serum lithium levels during concomitant use. 








7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists (including losartan) may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving losartan and NSAID therapy. 

The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including losartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors. 








7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, syncope, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. 

The Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D) trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 mL/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end stage renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group. 

In most patients no benefit has been associated with using two RAS inhibitors concomitantly. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on losartan potassium and other agents that affect the RAS. 
         
 
  
 Do not coadminister aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with losartan potassium in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).","Lithium, NSAIDs, COX-2 Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, ACE Inhibitors, Aliskiren, Lisinopril"

In clinical studies, no significant adverse reactions occurred with other drugs commonly used in the perioperative period, including: central nervous system depressants, autonomic drugs, skeletal muscle relaxants, anti-infective agents, hormones and synthetic substitutes, blood derivatives, and cardiovascular drugs.

Epinephrine

Epinephrine administered with sevoflurane may increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Monitor the electrocardiogram and blood pressure and ensure emergency medications to treat ventricular arrhythmias are readily available.

Calcium antagonists

Sevoflurane may lead to marked hypotension in patients treated with calcium antagonists. Blood pressure should be closely monitored and emergency medications to treat hypotension should be readily available when calcium antagonists are used concomitantly with sevoflurane.
In animals, impairment of atrioventricular conduction has been observed when verapamil and sevoflurane are administered concomitantly.

Succinylcholine

See
 
  
WARNINGS - Perioperative Hyperkalemia
.

 

Non-selective MAO-inhibitors

Concomitant use of MAO inhibitors and inhalational anesthetics may increase the risk of hemodynamic instability during surgery or medical procedures.

Intravenous Anesthetics

Sevoflurane administration is compatible with barbiturates, propofol, and other commonly used intravenous anesthetics.

Benzodiazepines and Opioids

Benzodiazepines and opioids would be expected to decrease the MAC of sevoflurane in the same manner as with other inhalational anesthetics. Sevoflurane administration is compatible with benzodiazepines and opioids as commonly used in surgical practice.

Nitrous Oxide

As with other halogenated volatile anesthetics, the anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N
 
  2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately 50% in adults, and approximately 25% in pediatric patients (see
 
  
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
).

 

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

As is the case with other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When used to supplement alfentanil-N
 
  2O anesthesia, sevoflurane and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane. 
    Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation. 
    Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the absence of specific guidelines:

 

For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.
During maintenance of anesthesia, the required dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N
  
   2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation.
 
  

The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied.","Epinephrine, verapamil, succinylcholine, MAO inhibitors, barbiturates, propofol, benzodiazepines, opioids, nitrous oxide, alfentanil, isoflurane, pancuronium, vecuronium, atracurium"

Table 3: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with Esomeprazole and Interaction with Diagnostics






Antiretrovirals




Clinical Impact:

Theeffect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind theseinteractions are notalways known. 
     

Decreased exposure of someantiretroviral drugs (e.g.,rilpivirine atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with esomeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance [see Clinical Pharmacology (
      
       12.3)].
     
      
Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with esomeprazole may increase toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (
      
       12.3)].
     
      
There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not resultin clinically relevant interactions with esomeprazole.





Intervention:


Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with esomeprazole magnesium is contraindicated [see Contraindications (
    
     4)].
    
     Atazanavir: See prescribing information for atazanavir fordosing information. 
     
Nelfinavir:Avoid concomitant use with esomeprazole magnesium. See prescribing information for nelfinavir. 
     
Saquinavir:See the prescribing information for saquinavir for monitoring of potential saquinavir-related toxicities. 
     
Other antiretrovirals:See prescribing information for specific antiretroviral drugs
   
    



Warfarin




Clinical Impact:

Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including esomeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.



Intervention:

Monitor INR and prothrombin time and adjust the dose of warfarin, if needed, to maintain the target INR range.



Methotrexate




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of esomeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted [see Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.12)].
   
    



Intervention:

A temporary withdrawal of esomeprazole magnesium may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.



2C19 Substrates (e.g., clopidogrel, citalopram, cilostazol)




Clopidogrel





Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of esomeprazole 40 mg resulted in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)]. 
       There are no adequate combination studies of a lower dose of esomeprazole or a higher dose of clopidogrel in comparison with the approved dose of clopidogrel.
   
    



Intervention:

Avoid concomitant use with esomeprazole magnesium. Consider use of alternative anti-platelet therapy [see Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.7)].
   
    



Citalopram





Clinical Impact:

Increased exposure of citalopram leading to an increased risk of QT prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)].
   
    



Intervention:

Limit the dose of citalopram to a maximum of 20 mg per day. See prescribing information for citalopram.



Cilostazol





Clinical Impact:

Increased exposure of cilostazol and one of its active metabolites (3,4-dihydro-cilostazol) [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)].
   
    



Intervention:

Consider reducing the dose of cilostazol to 50 mg twice daily. See prescribing information for cilostazol.



Digoxin





Clinical Impact:

Potential for increased exposure of digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)].
   
    



Intervention:

Monitor digoxin concentrations and adjust the dose, if needed, to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin.



Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. Amoxicillin also has drug interactions.



Intervention:

See Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin. See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin.



Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole)




Clinical Impact:

Esomeprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity



Intervention:

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of omeprazole, of which esomeprazole is an enantiomer, in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving esomeprazole magnesium and MMF. Use esomeprazole magnesium with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)]. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.
   
    



Tacrolimus





Clinical Impact:

Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.



Intervention:

Monitor tacrolimus whole blood concentrations and consider reducing the dose, if needed, to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus.



Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors




Clinical Impact:

Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors [see Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.11), Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.2)].
   
    



Intervention:

Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.



Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test




Clinical Impact:

Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.


Intervention:
Discontinue esomeprazole magnesium 4 weeks prior to testing [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.2)]
   
    



False Positive Urine Tests for THC




Clinical Impact:

There have been reports of false positive urine screening test for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.



Intervention:

An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results. 




Table 4: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Esomeprazole When Co-Administered with Other Drugs






CYP2C19 or CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

Decreased exposure of esomeprazole when used concomitantly with strong inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (
    
     12.3)].
   
    



Intervention:

St. John’s Wort, rifampin: Avoid concomitant use with [see Warnings and Precautions (
    
     5.10)]. Ritonavir-containing products: see prescribing information for specific drugs

Table 2. Drug Interactions with ALKINDI SPRINKLE





CYP3A4 Inhibitors




Clinical Impact:

Hydrocortisone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of inhibitors of CYP3A4 may lead to increases in serum concentrations of ALKINDI SPRINKLE and increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the use of excessive doses.



Intervention:

Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors may require a decrease in the ALKINDI SPRINKLE dose.



Examples:


Anti-fungals: itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole
Antibiotics: erythromycin and clarithromycin
Antiretrovirals: ritonavir                              			Grapefruit juice



CYP3A4 Inducers




Clinical Impact:

Hydrocortisone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Concomitant administration of inducers of CYP3A4 may lead to decreases in serum concentrations of ALKINDI SPRINKLE and increase the risk of adverse reactions, including adrenal crisis.



Intervention:

Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers may require an increase in the ALKINDI SPRINKLE dose.



Examples:


Anticonvulsants: phenytoin, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine
Antibiotics: rifampicin and rifabutin
Barbiturates:  phenobarbital and primidone
Antiretrovirals:  efavirenz and nevirapine



Estrogen and Estrogen Containing Products




Clinical Impact:

Oral estrogen and estrogen-containing oral contraceptives may interact with hydrocortisone by increasing serum cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) concentration. Concomitant use may reduce the efficacy of ALKINDI SPRINKLE by binding and delaying or preventing absorption.



Intervention:

Concomitant use of estrogen/estrogen containing products may require an increase in the ALKINDI SPRINKLE dose.



Antidiabetic Agents




Clinical Impact:

Corticosteroids in supraphysiologic doses may increase blood glucose concentrations.



Intervention:

Use of ALKINDI SPRINKLE in supraphysiologic doses may require a dose adjustment of antidiabetic agents.



Anticoagulant Agents




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of warfarin and corticosteroids usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports.



Intervention:

Monitor coagulation indices in patients receiving ALKINDI SPRINKLE and concomitant warfarin to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.



Cyclosporine




Clinical Impact:

Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use.



Intervention:

Monitor patients receiving ALKINDI SPRINKLE and concomitant cyclosporine.



Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)




Clinical Impact:

Concomitant use of NSAIDs and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids; this could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn.



Intervention:

Monitor patients receiving ALKINDI SPRINKLE and concomitant NSAIDs.

7.1 CYP2C19 Inducers

Since clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite partly by CYP2C19, use of drugs that induce the activity of this enzyme would be expected to result in increased drug levels of the active metabolite of clopidogrel.

Rifampin strongly induces CYP2C19 resulting to both an increase level of clopidogrel active metabolite and platelet inhibition, which in particular might potentiate the risk of bleeding. As a precaution, avoid concomitant use of strong CYP2C19 inducers
 
  [see 
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)and
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








7.2 CYP2C19 Inhibitors


Clopidogrel is metabolized to its active metabolite in part by CYP2C19. Concomitant use of drugs that inhibit the activity of this enzyme results in reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel and a reduction in platelet inhibition
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]
 
  . 
  

  Omeprazole or Esomeprazole 
   

  Avoid concomitant use of clopidogrel with omeprazole or esomeprazole. In clinical studies, omeprazole was shown to reduce significantly the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel when given concomitantly or 12 hours apart. A similar reduction in antiplatelet activity was observed with esomeprazole when given concomitantly with clopidogrel. Dexlansoprazole, lansoprazole, and pantoprazole had less effect on the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel than did omeprazole or esomeprazole
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.1)and
  
   
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)


].









7.3 Opioids

As with other oral P2Y
 
  12inhibitors, coadministration of opioid agonists delay and reduce the absorption of clopidogrel, presumably because of slowed gastric emptying, resulting in reduced exposure to its metabolites
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  . Consider the use of a parenteral antiplatelet agent in acute coronary syndrome patients requiring coadministration of morphine or other opioid agonists.

 








7.4 Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)


Coadministration of clopidogrel and NSAIDs increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.








7.5 Warfarin (CYP2C9 Substrates)


Although the administration of clopidogrel 75 mg per day did not modify the pharmacokinetics of S-warfarin (a CYP2C9 substrate) or INR in patients receiving long-term warfarin therapy, coadministration of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the risk of bleeding because of independent effects on hemostasis. 
  
  However, at high concentrations
 
  in vitro, clopidogrel inhibits CYP2C9.

 








7.6 SSRIs and SNRIs

Since selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect platelet activation, the concomitant administration of SSRIs and SNRIs with clopidogrel may increase the risk of bleeding.








7.7 Other Antiplatelet Agents

7.8 Repaglinide (CYP2C8 Substrates)

The acyl-β-glucuronide metabolite of clopidogrel is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C8. Clopidogrel can increase the systemic exposure to drugs that are primarily cleared by CYP2C8, thereby needing dose adjustment and appropriate monitoring. 
  
  Clopidogrel increased repaglinide exposures by 3.9-fold to 5.1-fold
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  . Avoid concomitant use of repaglinide with clopidogrel. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, initiate repaglinide at 0.5 mg before each meal and do not exceed a total daily dose of 4 mg. Increased frequency of glucose monitoring may be required during concomitant use.","Rifampin, Omeprazole, Esomeprazole, Dexlansoprazole, Lansoprazole, Pantoprazole, Morphine, Repaglinide"

ZIPRASIDONE capsules, for oral use

Initial U.S. Approval: 2001",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug-drug interactions can be pharmacodynamic (combined pharmacologic effects) or pharmacokinetic (alteration of plasma levels). The risks of using ziprasidone in combination with other drugs have been evaluated as described below. All interactions studies have been conducted with oral ziprasidone. Based upon the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile of ziprasidone, possible interactions could be anticipated:






Ziprasidone should not be used in combination with other drugs that have demonstrated QT prolongation. (
  
     4.1,
  
     7.3)
 
    
The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to two-fold in the presence of food. (
  
     7.10)
 
    
The full prescribing information contains additional drug interactions.
  
     (7).
 
    








7.1 Metabolic Pathway

Approximately two-thirds of ziprasidone is metabolized via a combination of chemical reduction by glutathione and enzymatic reduction by aldehyde oxidase. There are no known clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of aldehyde oxidase. Less than one-third of ziprasidone metabolic clearance is mediated by cytochrome P450 catalyzed oxidation.








7.2

 In VitroStudies


An in vitro enzyme inhibition study utilizing human liver microsomes showed that ziprasidone had little inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, and thus would not likely interfere with the metabolism of drugs primarily metabolized by these enzymes. There is little potential for drug interactions with ziprasidone due to displacement [See
 
  Clinical Pharmacology

(12.3)
].

 








7.3 Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Ziprasidone should not be used with any drug that prolongs the QT interval [See
 
  Contraindications

(4.1)
].

 
Given the primary CNS effects of ziprasidone, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs.
Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, ziprasidone may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
Ziprasidone may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
 
  









7.4 Pharmacokinetic Interactions


Carbamazepine


Carbamazepine is an inducer of CYP3A4; administration of 200 mg twice daily for 21 days resulted in a decrease of approximately 35% in the AUC of ziprasidone. This effect may be greater when higher doses of carbamazepine are administered.

 

Ketoconazole

Ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, at a dose of 400 mg QD for 5 days, increased the AUC and C
 
  maxof ziprasidone by about 35 to 40%. Other inhibitors of CYP3A4 would be expected to have similar effects.

 

Cimetidine


Cimetidine at a dose of 800 mg QD for 2 days did not affect ziprasidone pharmacokinetics.

 

Antacid

The co-administration of 30 mL of Maalox® with ziprasidone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ziprasidone.
 
  














7.5 Lithium

Ziprasidone at a dose of 40 mg twice daily administered concomitantly with lithium at a dose of 450 mg twice daily for 7 days did not affect the steady-state level or renal clearance of lithium. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to lithium in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic lithium levels.








7.6 Oral Contraceptives


In vivostudies have revealed no effect of ziprasidone on the pharmacokinetics of estrogen or progesterone components. Ziprasidone at a dose of 20 mg twice daily did not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered oral contraceptives, ethinyl estradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg).

 








7.7 Dextromethorphan

Consistent with in vitro results, a study in normal healthy volunteers showed that ziprasidone did not alter the metabolism of dextromethorphan, a CYP2D6 model substrate, to its major metabolite, dextrorphan. There was no statistically significant change in the urinary dextromethorphan/dextrorphan ratio.








7.8 Valproate

A pharmacokinetic interaction of ziprasidone with valproate is unlikely due to the lack of common metabolic pathways for the two drugs. Ziprasidone dosed adjunctively to valproate in a maintenance trial of bipolar patients did not affect mean therapeutic valproate levels.








7.9 Other Concomitant Drug Therapy

Population pharmacokinetic analysis of schizophrenic patients enrolled in controlled clinical trials has not revealed evidence of any clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with benztropine, propranolol, or lorazepam.








7.10 Food Interaction

The absolute bioavailability of a 20 mg dose under fed conditions is approximately 60%. The absorption of ziprasidone is increased up to two-fold in the presence of food [

7.1 Ergot-containing Drugs

Ergot-containing drugs have been reported to cause prolonged vasospastic reactions. Because these effects may be additive, use of ergotamine containing or ergot-type medications (like dihydroergotamine or methysergide) and zolmitriptan within 24 hours of each other is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].








7.2 MAO-A Inhibitors

MAO-A inhibitors increase the systemic exposure of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite. Therefore, the use of zolmitriptan in patients receiving MAO-A inhibitors is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.3 5-HT1B/1D agonists

Concomitant use of other 5-HT1B/1D agonists (including triptans) within 24 hours of zolmitriptan treatment is contraindicated because the risk of vasospastic reactions may be additive [see Contraindications (4)].








7.4 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors and Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors

Cases of life-threatening serotonin syndrome have been reported during co-administration of triptans and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)].








7.5 Cimetidine

Following administration of cimetidine, the half-life and blood levels of zolmitriptan and its active N-desmethyl metabolite were approximately doubled [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Coadministration of strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP may increase pazopanib concentrations. Avoid concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with strong inhibitors of P-gp or BCRP. Consider selection of alternative concomitant medicinal products with no or minimal potential to inhibit P-gp or BCRP.








7.2 Effects of Pazopanib Tablets on Other Drugs

CYP Substrates
Coadministration of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 may result in inhibition of the metabolism of these products and create the potential for serious adverse reactions. The concomitant use of pazopanib tablets with agents with narrow therapeutic windows that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C8 is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA
 
  Asites and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and monitor patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

 
The benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, produce increased CNS-depressant effects when administered with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, barbiturates, antipsychotics, sedative/hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, narcotic analgesics, sedative antihistamines, anticonvulsants, and anesthetics.
Concomitant use of clozapine and lorazepam may produce marked sedation, excessive salivation, hypotension, ataxia, delirium and respiratory arrest.
Concurrent administration of lorazepam with valproate may result in increased plasma concentrations and reduced clearance of lorazepam. Lorazepam dosage should be reduced to approximately 50% when coadministered with valproate.
Concurrent administration of lorazepam with probenecid may result in a more rapid onset or prolonged effect of lorazepam due to increased half-life and decreased total clearance. Lorazepam dosage needs to be reduced by approximately 50% when coadministered with probenecid.
The effects of probenecid and valproate on lorazepam may be due to inhibition of glucuronidation.

7.1 Drugs Affecting Glucose Metabolism


A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require glimepiride dose adjustment and particularly close monitoring for hypoglycemia or worsening glycemic control.
The following are examples of medications that may increase the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, increasing the susceptibility to and/or intensity of hypoglycemia: oral anti-diabetic medications, pramlintide acetate, insulin, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists, fibrates, propoxyphene, pentoxifylline, somatostatin analogs, anabolic steroids and androgens, cyclophosphamide, phenyramidol, guanethidine, fluconazole, sulfinpyrazone, tetracyclines, clarithromycin, disopyramide, quinolones, and those drugs that are highly protein-bound, such as fluoxetine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, salicylates, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, coumarins, probenecid and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control.
The following are examples of medications that may reduce the glucose-lowering effect of sulfonylureas including glimepiride, leading to worsening glycemic control: danazol, glucagon, somatropin, protease inhibitors, atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), barbiturates, diazoxide, laxatives, rifampin, thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid hormones, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics (e.g., epinephrine, albuterol, terbutaline), and isoniazid. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are withdrawn from a patient receiving glimepiride, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia.
Beta-blockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of glimepiride’s glucose-lowering effect.
Both acute and chronic alcohol intake may potentiate or weaken the glucose-lowering action of glimepiride in an unpredictable fashion.
The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine.









7.2 Miconazole


A potential interaction between oral miconazole and sulfonylureas leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported. Whether this interaction also occurs with other dosage forms of miconazole is not known.









7.3 Cytochrome P450 2C9 Interactions


There may be an interaction between glimepiride and inhibitors (e.g., fluconazole) and inducers (e.g., rifampin) of cytochrome P450 2C9. Fluconazole may inhibit the metabolism of glimepiride, causing increased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to hypoglycemia. Rifampin may induce the metabolism of glimepiride, causing decreased plasma concentrations of glimepiride which may lead to worsening glycemic control.









7.4 Concomitant Administration of Colesevelam


Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glimepiride when the two are coadministered. However, absorption is not reduced when glimepiride is administered 4 hours prior to colesevelam.

Colchicine is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Of the cytochrome P450 enzymes tested, CYP3A4 was mainly involved in the metabolism of colchicine. If colchicine is administered with drugs that inhibit P-gp, most of which also inhibit CYP3A4, increased concentrations of colchicine are likely. Fatal drug interactions have been reported.
Physicians should ensure that patients are suitable candidates for treatment with colchicine and remain alert for signs and symptoms of toxicities related to increased colchicine exposure as a result of a drug interaction. Signs and symptoms of colchicine toxicity should be evaluated promptly and, if toxicity is suspected, colchicine should be discontinued immediately.

Drugs with Ototoxic Potential 

(See 
WARNINGS

)
Especially in the presence of impaired renal function, the use of parenterally administered bumetanide in patients to whom aminoglycoside antibiotics are also being given should be avoided, except in life-threatening conditions.








Drugs with Nephrotoxic Potential

There has been no experience with the concurrent use of bumetanide with drugs known to have a nephrotoxic potential. Therefore, the simultaneous administration of these drugs should be avoided.








Lithium

Lithium should generally not be given with diuretics (such as bumetanide) because they reduce its renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.








Probenecid

Pretreatment with probenecid reduces both the natriuresis and hyperreninemia produced by bumetanide. This antagonistic effect of probenecid on bumetanide natriuresis is not due to a direct action on sodium excretion but is probably secondary to its inhibitory effect on renal tubular secretion of bumetanide. Thus, probenecid should not be administered concurrently with bumetanide.








Indomethacin

Indomethacin blunts the increases in urine volume and sodium excretion seen during bumetanide treatment and inhibits the bumetanide-induced increase in plasma renin activity. Concurrent therapy with bumetanide is thus not recommended.








Antihypertensives

Bumetanide may potentiate the effect of various antihypertensive drugs, necessitating a reduction in the dosage of these drugs.

Strong inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes and/or inducers of UGT (e.g., rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) have been shown to decrease the plasma/serum levels of MHD, the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine tablets (25% to 49%)
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
  If oxcarbazepine tablets and strong CYP3A4 inducers or UGT inducers are administered concurrently, it is recommended that the plasma levels of MHD be monitored during the period of oxcarbazepine tablets titration. Dose adjustment of oxcarbazepine tablets may be required after initiation, dosage modification, or discontinuation of such inducers.

7.1 Diuretics



Hypotension 


Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with benazepril hydrochloride. The possibility of hypotensive effects with benazepril hydrochloride can be minimized by either discontinuing or decreasing the dose of diuretic prior to initiation of treatment with benazepril hydrochloride [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. 



Hyperkalemia 


Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient’s serum potassium frequently. Benazepril hydrochloride attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics.








7.2 Antidiabetics

Concomitant administration of benazepril hydrochloride and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.








7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving benazepril and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including benazepril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.








7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual Blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on benazepril hydrochloride and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not coadminister aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with benazepril hydrochloride in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).








7.5 Mammalian Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) Inhibitors

Patients receiving coadministration of ACE inhibitor and mTOR inhibitor (e.g., temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema. Monitor for signs of angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].








7.6 Lithium

Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with benazepril hydrochloride. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium or benazepril hydrochloride. Monitor serum lithium levels during concurrent use.

7.1 Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL)

Bupropion is primarily metabolized to hydroxybupropion by CYP2B6. Therefore, the potential exists for drug interactions between bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and drugs that are inhibitors or inducers of CYP2B6.


Inhibitors of CYP2B6



Ticlopidine and Clopidogrel:Concomitant treatment with these drugs can increase bupropion exposures but decrease hydroxybupropion exposure. Based on clinical response, dosage adjustment of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may be necessary when coadministered with CYP2B6 inhibitors (e.g., ticlopidine or clopidogrel)
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
  



Inducers of CYP2B6



Ritonavir, Lopinavir, and Efavirenz:Concomitant treatment with these drugs can decrease bupropion and hydroxybupropion exposure. Dosage increase of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) may be necessary when coadministered with ritonavir, lopinavir, or efavirenz but should not exceed the maximum recommended dose
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
  


Carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin:While not systemically studied, these drugs may induce metabolism of bupropion and may decrease bupropion exposure
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
 
  If bupropion is used concomitantly with a CYP inducer, it may be necessary to increase the dose of bupropion, but the maximum recommended dose should not be exceeded.

 








7.2 Potential for Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets (XL) to Affect Other Drugs



Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6


Bupropion and its metabolites (erythrohydrobupropion, threohydrobupropion, hydroxybupropion) are CYP2D6 inhibitors. Therefore, coadministration of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with drugs that are metabolized by CYP2D6 can increase the exposures of drugs that are substrates of CYP2D6. Such drugs include certain antidepressants (e.g., venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol, risperidone, and thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, and flecainide). When used concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL), it may be necessary to decrease the dose of these CYP2D6 substrates, particularly for drugs with a narrow therapeutic index.
Drugs that require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 to be effective (e.g., tamoxifen), theoretically could have reduced efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as bupropion. Patients treated concomitantly with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and such drugs may require increased doses of the drug
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
 
  









7.3 Drugs That Lower Seizure Threshold

Use extreme caution when coadministering bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) with other drugs that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, antidepressants, theophylline, or systemic corticosteroids). Use low initial doses of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) and increase the dose gradually
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].
 
  









7.4 Dopaminergic Drugs (Levodopa and Amantadine)

Bupropion, levodopa, and amantadine have dopamine agonist effects. CNS toxicity has been reported when bupropion was coadministered with levodopa or amantadine. Adverse reactions have included restlessness, agitation, tremor, ataxia, gait disturbance, vertigo, and dizziness. It is presumed that the toxicity results from cumulative dopamine agonist effects. Use caution when administering bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) concomitantly with these drugs.








7.5 Use with Alcohol

In postmarketing experience, there have been rare reports of adverse neuropsychiatric events or reduced alcohol tolerance in patients who were drinking alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). The consumption of alcohol during treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) should be minimized or avoided.








7.6 MAO Inhibitors

Bupropion inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. Concomitant use of MAOIs and bupropion is contraindicated because there is an increased risk of hypertensive reactions if bupropion is used concomitantly with MAOIs. Studies in animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine. At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of an MAOI intended to treat depression and initiation of treatment with bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL). Conversely, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) before starting an MAOI antidepressant
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.8,
  
   2.9) and
  
   Contraindications (4)].
 
  









7.7 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions

False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for amphetamines have been reported in patients taking bupropion. This is due to lack of specificity of some screening tests. False-positive test results may result even following discontinuation of bupropion therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish bupropion from amphetamines.","ritonavir, lopinavir, efavirenz, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, venlafaxine, nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, sertraline, haloperidol, risperidone, thioridazine, metoprolol, propafenone, flecainide, levodopa, amantadine, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, tamoxifen, theophylline, systemic corticosteroids, phenelzine"

Significant drug interactions with lamotrigine are summarized in this section.
Uridine 5´-diphospho-glucuronyl transferases (UGT) have been identified as the enzymes responsible for metabolism of lamotrigine. Drugs that induce or inhibit glucuronidation may, therefore, affect the apparent clearance of lamotrigine. Strong or moderate inducers of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme, which are also known to induce UGT, may also enhance the metabolism of lamotrigine.
Those drugs that have been demonstrated to have a clinically significant impact on lamotrigine metabolism are outlined in Table 13. Specific dosing guidance for these drugs is provided in the Dosage and Administration section
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1)].

Effect of lamotrigine on Organic Cationic Transporter 2 Substrates

Lamotrigine is an inhibitor of renal tubular secretion via organic cationic transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may result in increased plasma levels of certain drugs that are substantially excreted via this route. Coadministration of lamotrigine with OCT2 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., dofetilide) is not recommended.","Valproate, Carbamazepine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Primidone, Rifampin, Estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, Lopinavir/ritonavir, Atazanavir/ritonavir, Ethinylestradiol, Levonorgestrel, Carbamazepine epoxide, Dofetilide"

There are no empirical data on avoiding drug interactions between Sevelamer carbonate and most concomitant oral drugs. For oral medication where a reduction in the bioavailability of that medication would have a clinically significant effect on its safety or efficacy (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus, levothyroxine), consider separation of the timing of the administration of the two drugs
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  . The duration of separation depends upon the absorption characteristics of the medication concomitantly administered, such as the time to reach peak systemic levels and whether the drug is an immediate-release or an extended-release product. Where possible consider monitoring clinical responses and/or blood levels of concomitant drugs that have a narrow therapeutic range.

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on Quetiapine

The risks of using quetiapine in combination with other drugs have not been extensively evaluated in systematic studies. Given the primary CNS effects of quetiapine, caution should be used when it is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs. Quetiapine potentiated the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol in a clinical trial in subjects with selected psychotic disorders, and alcoholic beverages should be limited while taking quetiapine.

Quetiapine exposure is increased by the prototype CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, indinavir, ritonavir, nefazodone, etc.) and decreased by the prototype CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, avasimibe, St. John’s wort etc.). Dose adjustment of quetiapine will be necessary if it is co-administered with potent CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors.

CYP3A4 inhibitors:
Coadministration of ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome CYP3A4, resulted in significant increase in quetiapine exposure. The dose of quetiapine should be reduced to one sixth of the original dose if co-administered with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 

CYP3A4 inducers:
Coadministration of quetiapine and phenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer increased the mean oral clearance of quetiapine by 5- fold. Increased doses of quetiapine up to 5 fold may be required to maintain control of symptoms of schizophrenia in patients receiving quetiapine and phenytoin, or other known potent CYP3A4 inducers
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. When the CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, the dose of quetiapine should be reduced to the original level within 7-14 days
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)].

 

Anticholinergic Drugs:
Concomitant treatment with quetiapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Quetiapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.20)].


The potential effects of several concomitant medications on quetiapine pharmacokinetics were studied
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

 








7.2 Effect of Quetiapine on Other Drugs

Because of its potential for inducing hypotension, Quetiapine may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.

Quetiapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.

There are no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interactions of quetiapine on other drugs based on the CYP pathway. Quetiapine and its metabolites are non-inhibitors of major metabolizing CYP’s (1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4).","ketoconazole, ritonavir, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort, itraconazole, indinavir, nefazodone, carbamazepine, avasimibe"

Clinical Recommendation






Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors (e.g., quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine)


The concomitant use of aripiprazole with strong CYP 3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors increased the exposure of aripiprazole compared to the use of aripiprazole alone 
             
     
      [see Clinical Pharmacology (

7.2 Drugs Having No Clinically Important Interactions with Aripiprazole  

Based on pharmacokinetic studies, no dosage adjustment of aripiprazole is required when administered concomitantly with famotidine, valproate, lithium, lorazepam.
In addition, no dosage adjustment is necessary for substrates of CYP2D6 (e.g., dextromethorphan, fluoxetine, paroxetine, or venlafaxine), CYP2C9 (e.g., warfarin), CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, warfarin, escitalopram), or CYP3A4 (e.g., dextromethorphan) when co-administered with aripiprazole. Additionally, no dosage adjustment is necessary for valproate, lithium, lamotrigine, lorazepam, or sertraline when co-administered with aripiprazole.

7.1 Nelfinavir

Coadministration of nelfinavir at steady-state with a single oral dose of azithromycin resulted in increased azithromycin serum concentrations. Although a dose adjustment of azithromycin is not recommended when administered in combination with nelfinavir, close monitoring for known adverse reactions of azithromycin, such as liver enzyme abnormalities and hearing impairment, is warranted 
         
 
  [see Adverse Reactions (

7.2 Warfarin

Spontaneous postmarketing reports suggest that concomitant administration of azithromycin may potentiate the effects of oral anticoagulants such as warfarin, although the prothrombin time was not affected in the dedicated drug interaction study with azithromycin and warfarin. Prothrombin times should be carefully monitored while patients are receiving azithromycin and oral anticoagulants concomitantly.








7.3 Potential Drug-Drug Interactions with Macrolides

Interactions with digoxin or phenytoin have not been reported in clinical trials with azithromycin; however, no specific drug interaction studies have been performed to evaluate potential drug-drug interactions. However, drug interactions have been observed with other macrolide products. Until further data are developed regarding drug interactions when digoxin or phenytoin are used concomitantly with azithromycin careful monitoring of patients is advised.","Nelfinavir,Warfarin,Digoxin,Phenytoin"

DRUG INTERACTIONS


Ciprofloxacin is an inhibitor of human cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) mediated metabolism. Co-administration of ciprofloxacin tablets with other drugs primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 results in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and could lead to clinically significant adverse events of the co-administered drug.

Table 11: Drugs That are Affected by and Affecting Ciprofloxacin Tablets
 








Drugs That are Affected by Ciprofloxacin Tablets





  Drug(s)
 Recommendation 
 Comments


 Tizanidine
Contraindicated
Concomitant administration of tizanidine and ciprofloxacin tablets is contraindicated due to the potentiation of hypotensive and sedative effects of tizanidine 
    
     [see Contraindications (4.2)]



 Theophylline
Avoid Use (Plasma Exposure Likely to be Increased and Prolonged)
Concurrent administration of ciprofloxacin tablets with theophylline may result in increased risk of a patient developing central nervous system (CNS) or other adverse reactions. If concomitant use cannot be avoided, monitor serum levels of theophylline and adjust dosage as appropriate 
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.10)].
    
     



 Drugs Known to Prolong QT Interval
 Avoid Use
Ciprofloxacin tablets may further prolong the QT interval in patients receiving drugs known to prolong the QT interval (for example, class IA or III antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants, macrolides, antipsychotics)
    
      [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.12) and Use in  
        Specific Populations (
     
      8.5)]. 
    
     



Oral antidiabetic drugs
Use with caution 
       Glucose-lowering effect potentiated 
    
Hypoglycemia sometimes severe has been reported when ciprofloxacin tablets and oral antidiabetic agents, mainly sulfonylureas (for example, glyburide, glimepiride), were co-administered, presumably by intensifying the action of the oral antidiabetic agent. Fatalities have been reported. Monitor blood glucose when ciprofloxacin tablets are co-administered with oral antidiabetic drugs 
    
     [see Adverse Reactions (
     
      6.1)]. 
    
     



Phenytoin
Use with caution 
       Altered serum levels of phenytoin (increased and decreased) 
    
 To avoid the loss of seizure control associated with decreased phenytoin levels and to prevent phenytoin overdose-related adverse reactions upon ciprofloxacin tablets discontinuation in patients receiving both agents, monitor phenytoin therapy, including phenytoin serum concentration during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin tablets with phenytoin.


 Cyclosporine
Use with caution 
       (transient elevations in serum creatinine) 
    
 Monitor renal function (in particular serum creatinine) when ciprofloxacin tablets is co-administered with cyclosporine.


Anti-coagulant drugs 
     

Use with caution 
       (Increase in anticoagulant effect) 
    
The risk may vary with the underlying infection, age and general status of the patient so that the contribution of ciprofloxacin tablets to the increase in INR (international normalized ratio) is difficult to assess. Monitor prothrombin time and INR frequently during and shortly after co-administration of ciprofloxacin tablets with an oral anti-coagulant (for example, warfarin).


Methotrexate
 Use with caution Inhibition of methotrexate renal tubular transport potentially leading to increased methotrexate plasma levels
Potential increase in the risk of methotrexate associated toxic reactions. Therefore, carefully monitor patients under methotrexate therapy when concomitant ciprofloxacin tablets therapy is indicated.


 Ropinirole
 Use with caution
Monitoring for ropinirole-related adverse reactions and appropriate dose adjustment of ropinirole is recommended during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin tablets 
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.16)]. 
    
     



 Clozapine
 Use with caution
Careful monitoring of clozapine associated adverse reactions and appropriate adjustment of clozapine dosage during and shortly after co-administration with ciprofloxacin tablets are advised. 


 NSAIDs
Use with caution 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (but not acetyl salicylic acid) in combination of very high doses of quinolones have been shown to provoke convulsions in pre-clinical studies and in postmarketing. 


 Sildenafil
Use with caution 
       Two-fold increase in exposure 
    
Monitor for sildenafil toxicity
    
     [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 



 Duloxetine
Avoid Use 
       Five-fold increase in duloxetine exposure 
    
If unavoidable, monitor for duloxetine toxicity 


 Caffeine/Xanthine Derivatives
Use with caution 
       Reduced clearance resulting in elevated levels and prolongation of serum half-life 
    
Ciprofloxacin tablets inhibits the formation of paraxanthine after caffeine administration (or pentoxifylline containing products). Monitor for xanthine toxicity and adjust dose as necessary. 


 Zolpidem
Avoid Use 
Co-administration with ciprofloxacin may increase blood levels of zolpidem, concurrent use is not recommended 



 Drug(s) Affecting Pharmacokinetics of Ciprofloxacin Tablets



 Antacids, Sucralfate, Multivitamins and Other Products Containing Multivalent Cations (magnesium/aluminum antacids; polymeric phosphate binders (for example, sevelamer, lanthanum carbonate); sucralfate; Videx® (didanosine) chewable/buffered tablets or pediatric powder; other highly buffered drugs; or products containing calcium, iron, or zinc and dairy products)
Ciprofloxacin tablets should be taken at least two hours before or six hours after Multivalent cation-containing products administration
    
     [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 

Decrease ciprofloxacin tablets absorption, resulting in lower serum and urine levels 


 Probenecid
Use with caution 
       (interferes with renal tubular secretion of ciprofloxacin tablets and increases ciprofloxacin tablets serum levels) 
    
Potentiation of ciprofloxacin tablets toxicity may occur.

7.1 Drugs Affecting Glucose Metabolism

A number of medications affect glucose metabolism and may require glipizide extended-release tablets dose adjustment and close monitoring for hypoglycemia or worsening glycemic control. 
  
  The following are examples of medication that may increase the glucose lowering effect of glipizide extended-release tablets, increase the susceptibility to and/or intensity of hypoglycemia: antidiabetic agents, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blocking agents, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, pentoxifylline, pramlintide, propoxyphene, salicylates, somatostatin analogs (e.g., octreotide), sulfonamide antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, chloramphenicol, probenecid, coumarins, voriconazole, H2 receptor antagonists, and quinolones. When these medications are administered to a patient receiving glipizide extended-release tablets, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. When these medications are discontinued from a patient receiving glipizide extended-release tablets, monitor the patient closely for worsening glycemic control. 
  
  The following are examples of medication that may reduce the glucose-lowering effect of glipizide extended-release tablets, leading to worsening glycemic control: atypical antipsychotics (e.g., olanzapine and clozapine), corticosteroids, danazol, diuretics, estrogens, glucagon, isoniazid, niacin, oral contraceptives, phenothiazines, progestogens (e.g., in oral contraceptives), protease inhibitors, somatropin, sympathomimetic agents (e.g., albuterol, epinephrine, terbutaline), thyroid hormones, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, and calcium channel blocking drugs. When such drugs are administered to patients receiving glipizide extended-release tablets, monitor the patients closely for worsening glycemic control. When these medications are discontinued from patients receiving glipizide extended-release tablets, monitor the patient closely for hypoglycemia. 
  
  Alcohol, beta-blockers, clonidine, and reserpine may lead to either potentiation or weakening of the   glucose-lowering effect. Increased frequency of monitoring may be required when glipizide extended-release tablets is co-administered with these drugs. 
  
  The signs of hypoglycemia may be reduced or absent in patients taking sympatholytic drugs such as beta-blockers, clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine. Increased frequency of monitoring may be required when glipizide extended-release tablets is co-administered with these drugs.
 








7.2 Miconazole

Monitor patients closely for hypoglycemia when glipizide extended-release tablets are co-administered with miconazole. A potential interaction between oral miconazole and oral hypoglycemic agents leading to severe hypoglycemia has been reported
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








7.3 Fluconazole

Monitor patients closely for hypoglycemia when glipizide extended-release tablets are co-administered with fluconazole. Concomitant treatment with fluconazole increases plasma concentrations of glipizide, which may lead to hypoglycemia
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  .

 








7.4 Colesevelam

Glipizide extended-release tablets should be administered at least 4 hours prior to the administration of colesevelam. Colesevelam can reduce the maximum plasma concentration and total exposure of glipizide when the two are coadministered

7.1 Mycophenolic Acid

When tacrolimus is prescribed with a given dose of a mycophenolic acid (MPA) product, exposure to MPA is higher with tacrolimus co-administration than with cyclosporine co-administration with MPA, because cyclosporine interrupts the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA while tacrolimus does not. Monitor for MPA-associated adverse reactions and reduce the dose of concomitantly administered mycophenolic acid products as needed.

Initial U.S. Approval: 2001VALGANCICLOVIR HYDROCHLORIDE, for oral solution",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


In vivo drug-drug interaction studies were not conducted with valganciclovir. However, because valganciclovir is rapidly and extensively converted to ganciclovir, drug-drug interactions associated with ganciclovir will be expected for Valganciclovir. Drug-drug interaction studies with ganciclovir were conducted in patients with normal renal function. Following concomitant administration of valganciclovir and other renally excreted drugs, patients with impaired renal function may have increased concentrations of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug. Therefore, these patients should be closely monitored for toxicity of ganciclovir and the coadministered drug.
 
Established and other potentially significant drug interactions conducted with ganciclovir are listed in Table 9.

7.1

 Antacids With Magnesium and Aluminum Hydroxides


Concomitant use of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids decreased plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets and antacids not be administered simultaneously
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.2 Azathioprine

Given that azathioprine and MMF inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or MMF.








7.3 Cholestyramine, Bile Acid Sequestrates, Oral Activated Charcoal and Other Drugs That Interfere With Enterohepatic Recirculation

Drugs that interrupt enterohepatic recirculation may decrease MPA plasma concentrations when coadministered with MMF. Therefore, do not administer mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, e.g., bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.4  Sevelamer

Concomitant administration of sevelamer and MMF may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Sevelamer and other calcium-free phosphate binders should not be administered simultaneously with mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.5 Cyclosporine

Cyclosporine inhibits the enterohepatic recirculation of MPA, and therefore, MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are coadministered with cyclosporine. Clinicians should be aware that there is also a potential change of MPA plasma concentrations after switching from cyclosporine to other immunosuppressive drugs or from other immunosuppressive drugs to cyclosporine in patients concomitantly receiving mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
]. 

 








7.6 Norfloxacin and Metronidazole

MPA plasma concentrations may be decreased when MMF is administrated with norfloxacin and metronidazole. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with the combination of norfloxacin and metronidazole. Although there will be no effect on MPA plasma concentrations when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole when given separately
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.7 Rifampin

The concomitant administration of MMF and rifampin may decrease MPA plasma concentrations. Therefore, mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are not recommended to be given with rifampin concomitantly unless the benefit outweighs the risk
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.8 Hormonal Contraceptives

In a drug interaction study, mean levonorgestrel AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with MMF. Although mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets may not have any influence on the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives, additional barrier contraceptive methods must be used when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablets are coadministered with hormonal contraceptives (e.g., birth control pill, transdermal patch, vaginal ring, injection, and implant)
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.1), Use in Specific Populations (
  
   8.3), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].
 
  









7.9 Acyclovir (Valacyclovir), Ganciclovir (Valganciclovir), and Other Drugs That Undergo Renal Tubular Secretion

The coadministration of MMF and acyclovir or ganciclovir may increase plasma concentrations of mycophenolic acid glucuronide (MPAG) and acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir as their coexistence competes for tubular secretion. Both acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir and MPAG concentrations will be also increased in the presence of renal impairment.
Acyclovir/valacyclovir/ganciclovir/valganciclovir may be taken with mycophenolic acid; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  
].

 








7.10 Ciprofloxacin, Amoxicillin Plus Clavulanic Acid and Other Drugs That Alter the Gastrointestinal Flora

Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora, such as ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid may interact with MMF by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption when mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet is concomitantly administered with ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. The clinical relevance of this interaction is unclear; however, no dose adjustment of mycophenolic acid delayed-release tablet is needed when coadministered with these drugs
 
  [see
Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)

Rx only",DI,"Drug Interactions:








Effect of Concomitant Use of Benzodiazepines and Opioids:



The concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids increases the risk of respiratory depression because of actions at different receptor sites in the CNS that control respiration. Benzodiazepines interact at GABA
 
  Asites, and opioids interact primarily at mu receptors. When benzodiazepines and opioids are combined, the potential for benzodiazepines to significantly worsen opioid-related respiratory depression exists. Limit dosage and duration of concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids, and follow patients closely for respiratory depression and sedation.

 










Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs:



Clonazepam does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine or phenobarbital. Clonazepam has the potential to influence concentrations of phenytoin. Monitoring of phenytoin concentration is recommended when clonazepam is co-administrated with phenytoin. The effect of clonazepam on the metabolism of other drugs has not been investigated.










Effect of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Clonazepam:



Literature reports suggest that ranitidine, an agent that decreases stomach acidity, does not greatly alter clonazepam pharmacokinetics.
In a study in which the 2 mg clonazepam orally disintegrating tablet was administered with and without propantheline (an anticholinergic agent with multiple effects on the GI tract) to healthy volunteers, the AUC of clonazepam was 10% lower and the C
 
  maxof clonazepam was 20% lower when the orally disintegrating tablet was given with propantheline compared to when it was given alone.

 
The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors sertraline (weak CYP3A4 inducer) and fluoxetine (CYP2D6 inhibitor), and the anti-epileptic drug felbamate (CYP2C19 inhibitor and CYP3A4 inducer) do not affect the pharmacokinetics of clonazepam. Cytochrome P 450 inducers, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital induce clonazepam metabolism, causing an approximately 38% decrease in plasma clonazepam levels. Although clinical studies have not been performed, based on the involvement of the cytochrome P-450 3A family in clonazepam metabolism, inhibitors of this enzyme system, notably oral antifungal agents (e.g., fluconazole), should be used cautiously in patients receiving clonazepam because they may impair the metabolism of clonazepam leading to exaggerated concentrations and effects.










Pharmacodynamic Interactions:



The CNS-depressant action of the benzodiazepine class of drugs may be potentiated by alcohol, narcotics, barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics, antianxiety agents, the phenothiazines, thioxanthene and butyrophenone classes of antipsychotic agents, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and the tricyclic antidepressants, and by other anticonvulsant drugs.Effect of Clonazepam on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs:

Table 2:  Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Tramadol Hydrochloride Tablets








Inhibitors of CYP2D6





Clinical Impact:


The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and CYP2D6 inhibitors may result in an increase in the plasma concentration of tramadol and a decrease in the plasma concentration of M1, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of tramadol hydrochloride tablets is achieved. Since M1 is a more potent µ-opioid agonist, decreased M1 exposure could result in decreased therapeutic effects, and may result in signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol. Increased tramadol exposure can result in increased or prolonged therapeutic effects and increased risk for serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome. After stopping a CYP2D6 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease and the M1 plasma concentration will increase. This could increase or prolong therapeutic effects but also increase adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity, such as potentially fatal respiratory depression [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)].
    
     




Intervention:


If concomitant use of a CYP2D6 inhibitor is necessary, evaluate patients at frequent intervals for adverse reactions including opioid withdrawal, seizures and serotonin syndrome. If a CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued, consider lowering tramadol hydrochloride tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients at frequent intervals for adverse events including respiratory depression and sedation.




Examples:


Quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and bupropion





Inhibitors of CYP3A4





Clinical Impact:


The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and CYP3A4 inhibitors can increase the plasma concentration of tramadol and may result in a greater amount of metabolism via CYP2D6 and greater levels of M1. Follow patients closely for increased risk of serious adverse events including seizures and serotonin syndrome, and adverse reactions related to opioid toxicity including potentially fatal respiratory depression, particularly when an inhibitor is added after a stable dose of tramadol hydrochloride tablets is achieved.
After stopping a CYP3A4 inhibitor, as the effects of the inhibitor decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will decrease [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)], resulting in decreased opioid efficacy or a withdrawal syndrome in patients who had developed physical dependence to tramadol.
    
     




Intervention:


If concomitant use is necessary, consider dosage reduction of tramadol hydrochloride tablets until stable drug effects are achieved. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of seizures, serotonin syndrome, and signs of respiratory depression and sedation.
If a CYP3A4 inhibitor is discontinued, consider increasing the tramadol hydrochloride tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal.




Examples:


Macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), azole-antifungal agents (e.g. ketoconazole), protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir)





CYP3A4 Inducers





Clinical Impact:


The concomitant use of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and CYP3A4 inducers can decrease the plasma concentration of tramadol [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)], resulting in decreased efficacy or onset of a withdrawal syndrome in patients who have developed physical dependence to tramadol.
    
     
After stopping a CYP3A4 inducer, as the effects of the inducer decline, the tramadol plasma concentration will increase [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)], which could increase or prolong both the therapeutic effects and adverse reactions, and may cause seizures, serotonin syndrome, and/or potentially fatal respiratory depression.
    
     




Intervention:


If concomitant use is necessary, consider increasing the tramadol hydrochloride tablets dosage until stable drug effects are achieved. Evaluate patients for signs of opioid withdrawal. If a CYP3A4 inducer is discontinued, consider tramadol hydrochloride tablets dosage reduction and evaluate patients at frequent intervals for signs of respiratory depression and sedation.
Patients taking carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 inducer, may have a significantly reduced analgesic effect of tramadol. Because carbamazepine increases tramadol metabolism and because of the seizure risk associated with tramadol, concomitant administration of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and carbamazepine is not recommended.




Examples:


Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenytoin





Benzodiazepines and Other Central Nervous System (CNS) Depressants





Clinical Impact:


Due to additive pharmacologic effect, the concomitant use of benzodiazepines or other CNS depressants, including alcohol, increases the risk of respiratory depression, profound sedation, coma, and death.




Intervention:


Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Inform patients and caregivers of this potential interaction, educate them on the signs and symptoms of respiratory depression (including sedation) [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.7)]. If concomitant use is warranted, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (
     
      2.2), Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.1,
     
      5.2,
     
      5.3)].
    
     




Examples:


Benzodiazepines and other sedatives/hypnotics, anxiolytics, tranquilizers, muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, antipsychotics, other opioids, and alcohol.





Serotonergic Drugs





Clinical Impact:


The concomitant use of opioids with other drugs that affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter system has resulted in serotonin syndrome.




Intervention:


If concomitant use is warranted, frequently evaluate the patient, particularly during treatment initiation and dose adjustment. Discontinue tramadol hydrochloride tablets immediately if serotonin syndrome is suspected.




Examples:


Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), triptans, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, drugs that affect the serotonin neurotransmitter system (e.g., mirtazapine, trazodone, tramadol), certain muscle relaxants (i.e., cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone), monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid and intravenous methylene blue).





Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)





Clinical Impact:


MAOI interactions with opioids may manifest as serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.9)] or opioid toxicity (e.g., respiratory depression, coma) [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.2)].
    
     




Intervention:


Do not use tramadol hydrochloride tablets in patients taking MAOIs or within 14 days of stopping such treatment.




Examples:


phenelzine, tranylcypromine, linezolid





Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics





Clinical Impact:


May reduce the analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and/or precipitate withdrawal symptoms.




Intervention:


Avoid concomitant use.




Examples:


butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine, buprenorphine





Muscle Relaxants





Clinical Impact:


Tramadol may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.




Intervention:


Because respiratory depression may be greater than otherwise expected, decrease the  dosage of tramadol hydrochloride tablets and/or the muscle relaxant as necessary. Due to the risk of respiratory depression with concomitant use of skeletal muscle relaxants and opioids, consider prescribing naloxone for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose [see Dosage and Administration (
     
      2.2), Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.2,
     
      5.3)].
    
     





Diuretics





Clinical Impact:


Opioids can reduce the efficacy of diuretics by inducing the release of antidiuretic hormone.




Intervention:


Evaluate patients for signs of diminished diuresis and/or effects on blood pressure and increase the dosage of the diuretic as needed.





Anticholinergic Drugs





Clinical Impact:


The concomitant use of anticholinergic drugs may increase risk of urinary retention and/or severe constipation, which may lead to paralytic ileus.




Intervention:


Evaluate patients for signs of urinary retention or reduced gastric motility when tramadol hydrochloride tablets are used concomitantly with anticholinergic drugs.





Digoxin





Clinical Impact:


Postmarketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of digoxin toxicity.




Intervention:


Evaluate patients for signs of digoxin toxicity and adjust dosage of digoxin as needed.





Warfarin





Clinical Impact:


Postmarketing surveillance of tramadol has revealed rare reports of alteration of warfarin effect, including elevation of prothrombin times.




Intervention:


Frequently reevaluate the prothrombin time of patients on warfarin for signs of an interaction and adjust the dosage of warfarin as needed.










Mixed Agonist/Antagonist and Partial Agonist Opioid Analgesics: Avoid use with tramadol hydrochloride tablets because they may reduce analgesic effect of tramadol hydrochloride tablets or precipitate withdrawal symptoms. (

7.1 CYP2D6 Inhibitors and Poor Metabolizers

Interactions of Carvedilol Tablet with potent inhibitors of CYP2D6 isoenzyme (such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone) have not been studied, but these drugs would be expected to increase blood levels of the R(+) enantiomer of Carvedilol Tablet [
 
  see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)
 
  ]. Retrospective analysis of side effects in clinical trials showed that poor 2D6 metabolizers had a higher rate of dizziness during uptitration, presumably resulting from vasodilating effects of the higher concentrations of the α-blocking R(+) enantiomer.

 








7.2 Hypotensive Agents

Patients taking both agents with β-blocking properties and a drug that can deplete catecholamines (e.g., reserpine and monoamine oxidase inhibitors) should be observed closely for signs of hypotension and/or severe bradycardia.
Concomitant administration of clonidine with agents with β-blocking properties may potentiate blood-pressureand heart-ratelowering effects. When concomitant treatment with agents with β-blocking properties and clonidine is to be terminated, the β-blocking agent should be discontinued first. Clonidine therapy can then be discontinued several days later by gradually decreasing the dosage.








7.3 Cyclosporine

Modest increases in mean trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed following initiation of Carvedilol Tablet treatment in 21 renal transplant patients suffering from chronic vascular rejection. In about 30% of patients, the dose of cyclosporine had to be reduced in order to maintain cyclosporine concentrations within the therapeutic range, while in the remainder no adjustment was needed. On the average for the group, the dose of cyclosporine was reduced about 20% in these patients. Due to wide interindividual variability in the dose adjustment required, it is recommended that cyclosporine concentrations be monitored closely after initiation of Carvedilol Tablet therapy and that the dose of cyclosporine be adjusted as appropriate.








7.4 Digitalis Glycosides

Both digitalis glycosides and β-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia. Digoxin concentrations are increased by about 15% when digoxin and Carvedilol Tablet are administered concomitantly. Therefore, increased monitoring of digoxin is recommended when initiating, adjusting, or discontinuing Carvedilol Tablet [
 
  see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.5)
 
  ].

 








7.5 Inducers/Inhibitors of Hepatic Metabolism

Rifampin reduced plasma concentrations of Carvedilol Tablet by about 70% [
 
  see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.5)
 
  ]. Cimetidine increased AUC by about 30% but caused no change in C
 
  max[
 
  see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.5)
 
  ].

 








7.6 Amiodarone

Amiodarone, and its metabolite desethyl amiodarone, inhibitors of CYP2C9 and P-glycoprotein, increased concentrations of the S(-)-enantiomer of Carvedilol Tablet by at least 2-fold [
 
  see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.5)
 
  ]. The concomitant administration of amiodarone or other CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole with Carvedilol Tablet may enhance the β-blocking properties of Carvedilol Tablet resulting in further slowing of the heart rate or cardiac conduction. Patients should be observed for signs of bradycardia or heart block, particularly when one agent is added to preexisting treatment with the other.

 








7.7 Calcium Channel Blockers

Conduction disturbance (rarely with hemodynamic compromise) has been observed when Carvedilol Tablets is coadministered with diltiazem. As with other agents with β-blocking properties, if Carvedilol Tablets is to be administered with calcium channel blockers of the verapamil or diltiazem type, it is recommended that ECG and blood pressure be monitored.








7.8 Insulin or Oral Hypoglycemics

Agents with β-blocking properties may enhance the blood-sugar-reducing effect of insulin and oral hypoglycemics. Therefore, in patients taking insulin or oral hypoglycemics, regular monitoring of blood glucose is recommended [
 
  see Warnings and Precautions (
  
   5.6)
 
  ].

 








7.9 Anesthesia

PROPAFENONE
 hydrochloride extended-release capsules, for oral use

Initial U.S. Approval: 1989",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS






Inhibitors of CYP2D6, 1A2, and 3A4 may increase propafenone levels which may lead to cardiac arrhythmias. Simultaneous use with both a CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitor (or in patients with CYP2D6 deficiency) should be avoided. (7.1) 

Propafenone may increase digoxin or warfarin levels. (7.2, 7.3) 

Orlistat may reduce propafenone concentrations. Abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stable on propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules has resulted in convulsions, atrioventricular block, and circulatory failure. (7.4) 

Concomitant use of lidocaine may increase central nervous system side effects. (7.6)









7.1  CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 Inhibitors


Drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 (such as desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline) and CYP3A4 (such as ketoconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice) can be expected to cause increased plasma levels of propafenone. The combination of CYP3A4 inhibition and either CYP2D6 deficiency or CYP2D6 inhibition with administration of propafenone may increase the risk of adverse reactions, including proarrhythmia. Therefore, simultaneous use of propafenone hydrochloride extended-release capsules with both a CYP2D6 inhibitor and a CYP3A4 inhibitor should be avoided [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4), Dosage and Administration (2)]. 


Amiodarone


Concomitant administration of propafenone and amiodarone can affect conduction and repolarization and is not recommended.


Cimetidine


Concomitant administration of propafenone immediate-release tablets and cimetidine in 12 healthy subjects resulted in a 20% increase in steady-state plasma concentrations of propafenone.


Fluoxetine


Concomitant administration of propafenone and fluoxetine in extensive metabolizers increased the S- propafenone Cmax and AUC by 39% and 50%, respectively, and the R-propafenone Cmax and AUC by 71% and 50%, respectively.


Quinidine


Small doses of quinidine completely inhibit the CYP2D6 hydroxylation metabolic pathway, making all patients, in effect, slow metabolizers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concomitant administration of quinidine (50 mg 3 times daily) with 150-mg immediate-release propafenone 3 times daily decreased the clearance of propafenone by 60% in extensive metabolizers, making them poor metabolizers. Steady-state plasma concentrations increased by more than 2-fold for propafenone and decreased 50% for 5-OH-propafenone. A 100-mg dose of quinidine increased steady-state concentrations of propafenone 3-fold. Avoid concomitant use of propafenone and quinidine.


Rifampin


Concomitant administration of rifampin and propafenone in extensive metabolizers decreased the plasma concentrations of propafenone by 67% with a corresponding decrease of 5-OH-propafenone by 65%. The concentrations of norpropafenone increased by 30%. In poor metabolizers, there was a 50% decrease in propafenone plasma concentrations and an increase in the AUC and Cmax of norpropafenone by 74% and 20%, respectively. Urinary excretion of propafenone and its metabolites decreased significantly. Similar results were noted in elderly patients: Both the AUC and Cmax of propafenone decreased by 84%, with a corresponding decrease in AUC and Cmax of 5-OH-propafenone by 69% and 57%, respectively.










7.2  Digoxin


Concomitant use of propafenone and digoxin increased steady-state serum digoxin exposure (AUC) in patients by 60% to 270% and decreased the clearance of digoxin by 31% to 67%. Monitor plasma digoxin levels of patients receiving propafenone and adjust digoxin dosage as needed.










7.3  Warfarin


The concomitant administration of propafenone and warfarin increased warfarin plasma concentrations at steady state by 39% in healthy volunteers and prolonged the prothrombin time (PT) in patients taking warfarin. Adjust the warfarin dose as needed by monitoring INR (international normalized ratio).










7.4 Orlistat


Orlistat may limit the fraction of propafenone available for absorption. In postmarketing reports, abrupt cessation of orlistat in patients stabilized on propafenone has resulted in severe adverse events including convulsions, atrioventricular block, and acute circulatory failure. 









7.5  Beta-Antagonists


Concomitant use of propafenone and propranolol in healthy subjects increased propranolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 113%. In 4 patients, administration of metoprolol with propafenone increased the metoprolol plasma concentrations at steady state by 100% to 400%. The pharmacokinetics of propafenone was not affected by the coadministration of either propranolol or metoprolol. In clinical trials using propafenone immediate-release tablets, patients who were receiving beta-blockers concurrently did not experience an increased incidence of side effects.










7.6  Lidocaine


No significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of propafenone or lidocaine have been seen following their concomitant use in patients. However, concomitant use of propafenone and lidocaine has been reported to increase the risks of central nervous system side effects of lidocaine.","desipramine, paroxetine, ritonavir, sertraline, ketoconazole, saquinavir, erythromycin, grapefruit juice, amiodarone, cimetidine, fluoxetine, quinidine, rifampin, digoxin, warfarin, orlistat, propranolol, metoprolol, lidocaine"

7.2 Other Drug Interactions with Venlafaxine Hydrochloride Extended-Release Capsules


Central Nervous System (CNS)-Active Drugs


The risk of using venlafaxine concomitantly with other CNS-active drugs (including alcohol) has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised when venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are taken concomitantly in combination with other CNS-active drugs.


Weight Loss Agents


Concomitant use of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules and weight loss agents is not recommended. The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine therapy in combination with weight loss agents, including phentermine, have not been established. Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are not indicated for weight loss alone or in combination with other products.


Laboratory Test Interference


False-positive urine immunoassay screening tests for phencyclidine (PCP) and amphetamine have been reported in patients taking venlafaxine due to lack of specificity of the screening tests. False-positive test results may be expected for several days following discontinuation of venlafaxine therapy. Confirmatory tests, such as gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, will distinguish venlafaxine from PCP and amphetamine.","linezolid, intravenous methylene blue, SNRIs, SSRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, St. John's Wort, antiplatelet, anticoagulant, CYP3A inhibitor, CYP2D6 substrate, alcohol, phentermine"

 Rx only",DI,"Drug Interactions


All drug interaction studies were conducted with propranolol. There are no data on drug interactions with propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules.

Interactions with Substrates, Inhibitors or Inducers of Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes

Because propranolol’s metabolism involves multiple pathways in the Cytochrome P-450 system (CYP2D6, 1A2, 2C19), co-administration with drugs that are metabolized by, or affect the activity (induction or inhibition) of one or more of these pathways may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions (see 
Drug Interactions
 under 
PRECAUTIONS
).

Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP2D6

Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by co-administration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as amiodarone, cimetidine, delavudin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, and ritonavir. No interactions were observed with either ranitidine or lansoprazole.

Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP1A2

Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by co-administration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP1A2, such as imipramine, cimetidine, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, ritonavir, theophylline, zileuton, zolmitriptan, and rizatriptan.

Substrates or Inhibitors of CYP2C19

Blood levels and/or toxicity of propranolol may be increased by co-administration with substrates or inhibitors of CYP2C19, such as fluconazole, cimetidine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, tenioposide, and tolbutamide. No interaction was observed with omeprazole.

Inducers of Hepatic Drug Metabolism

Blood levels of propranolol may be decreased by co-administration with inducers such as rifampin, ethanol, phenytoin, and phenobarbital. Cigarette smoking also induces hepatic metabolism and has been shown to increase up to 77% the clearance of propranolol, resulting in decreased plasma concentrations.

Cardiovascular Drugs


Antiarrhythmics

The AUC of propafenone is increased by more than 200% by co-administration of propranolol.
The metabolism of propranolol is reduced by co-administration of quinidine, leading to a two to three fold increased blood concentration and greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade.
The metabolism of lidocaine is inhibited by co-administration of propranolol, resulting in a 25% increase in lidocaine concentrations.

Calcium Channel Blockers

The mean Cmax and AUC of propranolol are increased respectively, by 50% and 30% by co-administration of nisoldipine and by 80% and 47%, by co-administration of nicardipine.
The mean Cmax and AUC of nifedipine are increased by 64% and 79%, respectively, by co-administration of propranolol.
Propranolol does not affect the pharmacokinetics of verapamil and norverapamil. Verapamil does not affect the pharmacokinetics of propranolol.

Non-Cardiovascular Drugs


Migraine Drugs

Administration of zolmitriptan or rizatriptan with propranolol resulted in increased concentrations of zolmitriptan (AUC increased by 56% and Cmax by 37%) or rizatriptan (the AUC and Cmax were increased by 67% and 75%, respectively).

Theophylline

Co-administration of theophylline with propranolol decreases theophylline oral clearance by 30% to 52%.

Benzodiazepines

Propranolol can inhibit the metabolism of diazepam, resulting in increased concentrations of diazepam and its metabolites. Diazepam does not alter the pharmacokinetics of propranolol.
The pharmacokinetics of oxazepam, triazolam, lorazepam, and alprazolam are not affected by co-administration of propranolol.

Neuroleptic Drugs

Co-administration of long-acting propranolol at doses greater than or equal to 160 mg/day resulted in increased thioridazine plasma concentrations ranging from 55% to 369% and increased thioridazine metabolite (mesoridazine) concentrations ranging from 33% to 209%.
Co-administration of chlorpromazine with propranolol resulted in a 70% increase in propranolol plasma level.

Anti-Ulcer Drugs

Co-administration of propranolol with cimetidine, a non-specific CYP450 inhibitor, increased propranolol AUC and Cmax by 46% and 35%, respectively. Co-administration with aluminum hydroxide gel (1,200 mg) may result in a decrease in propranolol concentrations.
Co-administration of metoclopramide with the long-acting propranolol did not have a significant effect on propranolol’s pharmacokinetics.

Lipid Lowering Drugs

Co-administration of cholestyramine or colestipol with propranolol resulted in up to 50% decrease in propranolol concentrations.
Co-administration of propranolol with lovastatin or pravastatin, decreased 18% to 23% the AUC of both, but did not alter their pharmacodynamics. Propranolol did not have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin.

Warfarin

Concomitant administration of propranolol and warfarin has been shown to increase warfarin bioavailability and increase prothrombin time.Drug Interactions 


Caution should be exercised when propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules are administered with drugs that have an affect on CYP2D6, 1A2, or 2C19 metabolic pathways. Co-administration of such drugs with propranolol may lead to clinically relevant drug interactions and changes on its efficacy and/or toxicity (see 
Drug Interactions
 in 
PHARMACOKINETICS AND DRUG METABOLISM
).

Alcohol when used concomitantly with propranolol, may increase plasma levels of propranolol.

Cardiovascular Drugs


Antiarrhythmics

Propafenone has negative inotropic and beta-blocking properties that can be additive to those of propranolol.
Quinidine increases the concentration of propranolol and produces greater degrees of clinical beta-blockade and may cause postural hypotension.
Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent with negative chronotropic properties that may be additive to those seen with β-blockers such as propranolol.
The clearance of lidocaine is reduced with administration of propranolol. Lidocaine toxicity has been reported following co-administration with propranolol.
Caution should be exercised when administering propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules with drugs that slow A-V nodal conduction, e.g., lidocaine and calcium channel blockers.

Digitalis Glycosides

Both digitalis glycosides and beta-blockers slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use can increase the risk of bradycardia.

Calcium Channel Blockers

Caution should be exercised when patients receiving a beta-blocker are administered a calcium-channel-blocking drug with negative inotropic and/or chronotropic effects. Both agents may depress myocardial contractility or atrioventricular conduction.
There have been reports of significant bradycardia, heart failure, and cardiovascular collapse with concurrent use of verapamil and beta-blockers.
Co-administration of propranolol and diltiazem in patients with cardiac disease has been associated with bradycardia, hypotension, high degree heart block, and heart failure.

ACE Inhibitors

When combined with beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors can cause hypotension, particularly in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.
The antihypertensive effects of clonidine may be antagonized by beta-blockers. Propranolol hydrochloride extended-release capsules should be administered cautiously to patients withdrawing from clonidine.

Alpha Blockers

Prazosin has been associated with prolongation of first dose hypotension in the presence of beta-blockers.
Postural hypotension has been reported in patients taking both beta-blockers and terazosin or doxazosin.

Reserpine

Patients receiving catecholamine-depleting drugs, such as reserpine should be closely observed for excessive reduction of resting sympathetic nervous activity, which may result in hypotension, marked bradycardia, vertigo, syncopal attacks, or orthostatic hypotension.

Inotropic Agents

Patients on long-term therapy with propranolol may experience uncontrolled hypertension if administered epinephrine as a consequence of unopposed alpha-receptor stimulation. Epinephrine is therefore not indicated in the treatment of propranolol overdose (see OVERDOSAGE).


Isoproterenol and Dobutamine

Propranolol is a competitive inhibitor of beta-receptor agonists, and its effects can be reversed by administration of such agents, e.g., dobutamine or isoproterenol. Also, propranolol may reduce sensitivity to dobutamine stress echocardiography in patients undergoing evaluation for myocardial ischemia.

Non-Cardiovascular Drugs


Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to blunt the antihypertensive effect of beta-adrenoreceptor blocking agents.
Administration of indomethacin with propranolol may reduce the efficacy of propranolol in reducing blood pressure and heart rate.

Antidepressants

The hypotensive effects of MAO inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants may be exacerbated when administered with beta-blockers by interfering with the beta blocking activity of propranolol.

Anesthetic Agents

Methoxyflurane and trichloroethylene may depress myocardial contractility when administered with propranolol.

Warfarin

Propranolol when administered with warfarin increases the concentration of warfarin. Prothrombin time, therefore, should be monitored.

Neuroleptic Drugs

Hypotension and cardiac arrest have been reported with the concomitant use of propranolol and haloperidol.

Thyroxine

Thyroxine may result in a lower than expected T3 concentration when used concomitantly with propranolol.","amiodarone, cimetidine, delavudin, fluoxetine, paroxetine, quinidine, ritonavir, ranitidine, lansoprazole, imipramine, ciprofloxacin, fluvoxamine, isoniazid, theophylline, zileuton, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan, fluconazole, tenioposide, tolbutamide, omeprazole, rifampin, ethanol, phenytoin, phenobarbital, cigarette smoking, propafenone, lidocaine, nisoldipine, nicardipine, nifedipine, verapamil, norverapamil, diazepam, oxazepam, triazolam, lorazepam, alprazolam, thioridazine, mesoridazine, chlorpromazine, aluminum hydroxide gel, metoclopramide, cholestyramine, colestipol, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, warfarin, alcohol, digitalis glycosides, diltiazem, clonidine, prazosin, terazosin, doxazosin, reserpine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dobutamine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, indomethacin, MAO inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, methoxyflurane, trichloroethylene, haloperidol, thyroxine"

See Table 3 for clinically significant drug interactions with diclofenac.

 Table 3: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Diclofenac 





 Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis





Clinical Impact:


 ● Diclofenac and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of diclofenac and anticoagulants have increased the risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. ● Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.




Intervention:


 Monitor patients with concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)].





 Aspirin 





Clinical Impact:


 Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
.





Intervention:


 Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]
.
 Diclofenac sodium topical solution is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.




 ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers 





Clinical Impact:


 ● NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). ● In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.




Intervention:


 ● During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. ● During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
.
 ● When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.




 Diuretics 





Clinical Impact:


 Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].





 Digoxin 





Clinical Impact:


 The concomitant use of diclofenac with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.




 Lithium 





Clinical Impact:


 NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.




 Methotrexate 





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction)




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.




 Cyclosporine 





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.




 NSAIDs and Salicylates 





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]
 Concomitant use of oral NSAIDs with diclofenac sodium topical solution has been evaluated in one Phase 3 controlled trial and in combination with oral diclofenac, compared to oral diclofenac alone, resulted in a higher rate of rectal hemorrhage (3% vs. less than 1%), and more frequent abnormal creatinine (12% vs. 7%), urea (20% vs. 12%) and hemoglobin (13% vs. 9%).




Intervention:


 The concomitant use of diclofenac with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended. Do not use combination therapy with diclofenac sodium topical solution and an oral NSAID unless the benefit outweighs the risk and conduct periodic laboratory evaluations.




 Pemetrexed 





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.











Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly using diclofenac sodium topical solution with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of diclofenac sodium topical solution and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended (7)

ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARB) or Beta-Blockers: Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium topical solution may diminish the antihypertensive effect of these drugs. Monitor blood pressure (7)

ACE Inhibitors and ARBs: Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium topical solution in elderly, volume depleted, or those with renal impairment may result in deterioration of renal function. In such high risk patients, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (7)

Diuretics: NSAIDs can reduce natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics. Monitor patients to assure diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects (7)

Digoxin: Concomitant use with diclofenac sodium topical solution can increase serum concentration and prolong half-life of digoxin.

Furosemide may increase the ototoxic potential of aminoglycoside antibiotics, especially in the presence of impaired renal function. Except in life-threatening situations, avoid this combination.
Furosemide should not be used concomitantly with ethacrynic acid because of the possibility of ototoxicity. Patients receiving high doses of salicylates concomitantly with furosemide, as in rheumatic disease, may experience salicylate toxicity at lower doses because of competitive renal excretory sites.
There is a risk of ototoxic effects if cisplatin and furosemide are given concomitantly. In addition, nephrotoxicity of nephrotoxic drugs such as cisplatin may be enhanced if furosemide is not given in lower doses and with positive fluid balance when used to achieve forced diuresis during cisplatin treatment.
Furosemide has a tendency to antagonize the skeletal muscle-relaxing effect of tubocurarine and may potentiate the action of succinylcholine.
Lithium generally should not be given with diuretics because they reduce lithium’s renal clearance and add a high risk of lithium toxicity.
Furosemide combined with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers may lead to severe hypotension and deterioration in renal function, including renal failure. An interruption or reduction in the dosage of furosemide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin receptor blockers may be necessary.
Potentiation occurs with ganglionic or peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs.
Furosemide may decrease arterial responsiveness to norepinephrine. However, norepinephrine may still be used effectively.
Simultaneous administration of sucralfate and furosemide tablets may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide. Patients receiving both drugs should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved. The intake of furosemide and sucralfate should be separated by at least two hours.
In isolated cases, intravenous administration of furosemide within 24 hours of taking chloral hydrate may lead to flushing, sweating attacks, restlessness, nausea, increase in blood pressure, and tachycardia. Use of furosemide concomitantly with chloral hydrate is therefore not recommended.
Phenytoin interferes directly with renal action of furosemide. There is evidence that treatment with phenytoin leads to decreased intestinal absorption of furosemide, and consequently to lower peak serum furosemide concentrations.
Methotrexate and other drugs that, like furosemide, undergo significant renal tubular secretion may reduce the effect of furosemide. Conversely, furosemide may decrease renal elimination of other drugs that undergo tubular secretion. High-dose treatment of both furosemide and these other drugs may result in elevated serum levels of these drugs and may potentiate their toxicity as well as the toxicity of furosemide.
Furosemide can increase the risk of cephalosporin-induced nephrotoxicity even in the setting of minor or transient renal impairment.
Concomitant use of cyclosporine and furosemide is associated with increased risk of gouty arthritis secondary to furosemide-induced hyperurecemia and cyclosporine impairment of renal urate excretion.
High doses (>80 mg) of furosemide may inhibit the binding of thyroid hormones to carrier proteins and result in transient increase in free thyroid hormones, followed by an overall decrease in total thyroid hormone levels.
One study in six subjects demonstrated that the combination of furosemide and acetylsalicylic acid temporarily reduced creatinine clearance in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. There are case reports of patients who developed increased BUN, serum creatinine and serum potassium levels, and weight gain when furosemide was used in conjunction with NSAIDs.
Literature reports indicate that coadministration of indomethacin may reduce the natriuretic and antihypertensive effects of furosemide in some patients by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Indomethacin may also affect plasma renin levels, aldosterone excretion, and renin profile evaluation. Patients receiving both indomethacin and furosemide should be observed closely to determine if the desired diuretic and/or antihypertensive effect of furosemide is achieved.","aminoglycoside antibiotics, ethacrynic acid, salicylates, cisplatin, nephrotoxic drugs, tubocurarine, succinylcholine, lithium, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, ganglionic blocking drugs, peripheral adrenergic blocking drugs, norepinephrine, sucralfate, chloral hydrate, phenytoin, methotrexate, cephalosporin, cyclosporine, acetylsalicylic acid, NSAIDs, indomethacin"

7.1 Cytochrome P450 1A2 Inhibitors and Inducers


In vitro metabolism studies showed that cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) is the major enzyme responsible for the metabolism of ropinirole. There is thus the potential for inducers or inhibitors of this enzyme to alter the clearance of ropinirole. Therefore, if therapy with a drug known to be a potent inducer or inhibitor of CYP1A2 is stopped or started during treatment with ropinirole tablets, adjustment of the dose of ropinirole tablets may be required. Coadministration of ciprofloxacin, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases the AUC and C
         
 
  max of ropinirole 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]. 
         
 
  Cigarette smoking is expected to increase the clearance of ropinirole since CYP1A2 is known to be induced by smoking 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]. 
         
 
  









7.2 Estrogens

Population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that higher doses of estrogens (usually associated with hormone replacement therapy) reduced the clearance of ropinirole. Starting or stopping hormone replacement therapy may require adjustment of dosage of ropinirole tablets 
         
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
          
  
   12.3)]

7.3 Dopamine Antagonists

Because ropinirole  is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists such as neuroleptics (e.g., phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide may reduce the efficacy of ropinirole tablets.","ciprofloxacin, cigarette smoking, estrogens, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes, metoclopramide"

See Table 1 for clinically significant drug interactions with flurbiprofen.

Table 1: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Flurbiprofen






Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis






Clinical Impact:




Flurbiprofen and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of flurbiprofen and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone.
Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.






Intervention:



Monitor patients with concomitant use of flurbiprofen with anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5)
     
      ].
    
     





Aspirin






Clinical Impact:



Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5)
     
      ].
    
     
Concurrent administration of aspirin lowers serum flurbiprofen concentrations. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known.





Intervention:



Concomitant use of flurbiprofen and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5)
     
      ].
    
     
Flurbiprofen is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.





ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers






Clinical Impact:




NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol).
In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, coadministration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.






Intervention:




During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained.
During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function [
      
       see Warnings and Precautions (
       
        5.6)
      
       ].
     
      
When drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.






Diuretics






Clinical Impact:



Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5)
     
      ].
    
     





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



The concomitant use of flurbiprofen with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin [
     
      see Clinical Pharmacology (
      
       12.3)
     
      ].
    
     





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.





Lithium






Clinical Impact:



NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance
     
      .The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.
    
     





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.





Methotrexate






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of flurbiprofen and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine’s nephrotoxicity.





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.





NSAIDs and Salicylates






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of flurbiprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5.2)
     
      ].
    
     





Intervention:



The concomitant use of flurbiprofen with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.





Pemetrexed






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of flurbiprofen and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention:



During concomitant use of flurbiprofen and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity.
NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.





Corticosteroids






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of corticosteroids with flurbiprofen may increase the risk of GI ulceration or bleeding.





Intervention:



Monitor patients with concomitant use of flurbiprofen with corticosteroids for signs of bleeding [
     
      see Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5.2)
     
      ].
    
     











Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (e.g. warfarin, aspirin, SSRIs/SNRIs): Monitor patients for bleeding who are concomitantly taking flurbiprofen with drugs that interfere with hemostasis. Concomitant use of flurbiprofen and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended (

Gemfibrozil






Clinical Impact:



There is an increased risk of myopathy/rhabdomyolysis when pravastatin is administered with gemfibrozil





Intervention:



Avoid concomitant use of gemfibrozil with pravastatin.





Cyclosporine






Clinical Impact:



The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine with pravastatin.





Intervention:



Initiate with a dosage of pravastatin sodium 10 mg once daily. Do not exceed pravastatin 20 mg once daily
     
      [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
    
     





Select Macrolide Antibiotics






Clinical Impact:



The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased by concomitant use of clarithromycin or erythromycin with pravastatin. Other macrolides (e.g., azithromycin) have the potential to increase pravastatin exposures and increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when used concomitantly.





Intervention:



For patients taking erythromycin or clarithromycin, do not exceed 40 mg pravastatin once daily
     
      [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].
    
     





Niacin






Clinical Impact:



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of niacin with pravastatin.





Intervention:



Consider if the benefit of using niacin concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.





Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil)






Clinical Impact:



Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with pravastatin.





Intervention:



Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.





Colchicine






Clinical Impact:



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with pravastatin.





Intervention:



Consider if the benefit of using colchicine concomitantly with pravastatin outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy, particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.

•Beta-blockers including metoprolol, may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. (7.4)








7.1 	Catecholamine Depleting Drugs 

Catecholamine depleting drugs (e.g., reserpine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors) may have an additive effect when given with beta-blocking agents. Observe patients treated with metoprolol tartrate tablets plus a catecholamine depletor for evidence of hypotension or marked bradycardia, which may produce vertigo, syncope, or postural hypotension.








7.2 	Epinephrine 

While taking beta-blockers, patients with a history of severe anaphylactic reactions to a variety of allergens may be more reactive to repeated challenge and may be unresponsive to the usual doses of epinephrine used to treat an allergic reaction.








7.3 	CYP2D6 Inhibitors 

Drugs that are strong inhibitors of CYP2D6 such as quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, and propafenone were shown to double metoprolol concentrations. While there is no information about moderate or weak inhibitors, these too are likely to increase metoprolol concentration. Increases in plasma concentration decrease the cardioselectivity of metoprolol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Monitor patients closely, when the combination cannot be avoided.








7.4 	Negative Chronotropes 

Digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem and verapamil slow atrioventricular conduction and decrease heart rate. Concomitant use with beta-blockers can increase the risk of bradycardia.
If clonidine and a beta-blocker, such as metoprolol are coadministered, withdraw the beta-blocker several days before the gradual withdrawal of clonidine because beta-blockers may exacerbate the rebound hypertension that can follow the withdrawal of clonidine. If replacing clonidine by beta-blocker therapy, delay the introduction of beta-blockers for several days after clonidine administration has stopped.Drug Interactions 

Metoprolol is metabolized predominantly by CYP2D6. In healthy subjects with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer phenotype, coadministration of quinidine 100 mg, a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, and immediate-release metoprolol 200 mg tripled the concentration of S-metoprolol and doubled the metoprolol elimination half-life. In four patients with cardiovascular disease, coadministration of propafenone 150 mg t.i.d. with immediate-release metoprolol 50 mg t.i.d. increased the steady-state metoprolol concentration 2- to 5-fold compared to metoprolol alone. Extensive metabolizers who concomitantly use CYP2D6 inhibiting drugs will have increased (several-fold) metoprolol blood levels, decreasing metoprolol's cardioselectivity [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].","reserpine, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, epinephrine, quinidine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, propafenone, digitalis glycosides, clonidine, diltiazem, verapamil"

Use with xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors: One of the pathways for inactivation of azathioprine is inhibited by XO inhibitors (allopurinol or febuxostat). Patients receiving Azathioprine Tablets and allopurinol concomitantly should have a dose reduction of Aazathioprine Tablets, to approximately 1/3 to 1/4 the usual dose. Concomitant use of Azathioprine Tablets with febuxostat is not recommended. Inhibition of XO may cause increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or its metabolite, 6-MP, leading to toxicity.It is recommended that a further dose reduction or alternative therapies be considered for patients with low or absent TPMT activity receiving Azathioprine Tablets and xanthine oxidase inhibitors because both TPMT and XO inactivation pathways are affected. See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS: Laboratory Tests and ADVERSE REACTIONS sections.

 



Use with Aminosalicylates: There is in vitro evidence that aminosalicylate derivatives (e.g., sulphasalazine, mesalazine, or olsalazine) inhibit the TPMT enzyme. Concomitant use of these agents with Azathioprine Tablets should be done with caution.

 

Use with Other Agents Affecting Myelopoesis: Drugs which may affect leukocyte production, including co-trimoxazole, may lead to exaggerated leukopenia, especially in renal transplant recipients.



Use with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors to control hypertension in patients on azathioprine has been reported to induce anemia and severe leukopenia.

 



Use with Warfarin: Azathioprine Tabletts may inhibit the anticoagulant effect of warfarin.

 



Use with Ribavirin: The use of ribavirin for hepatitis C in patients receiving azathioprine has been reported to induce severe pancytopenia and may increase the risk of azathioprine-related myelotoxicity. Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMDH) is required for one of the metabolic pathways of azathioprine. Ribavirin is known to inhibit IMDH, thereby leading to accumulation of an azathioprine metabolite, 6-methylthioionosine monophosphate (6MTITP), which is associated with myelotoxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia). Patients receiving azathioprine with ribavirin should have complete blood counts, including platelet counts, monitored weekly for the first month, twice monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly or more frequently if dosage or other therapy changes are necessary.

Rx only",DI,"Drug Interactions






Cholestyramine


Cholestyramine has been reported to reduce intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins; as such it may impair intestinal absorption of calcitriol (see
 
  
WARNINGS
and
 
  
PRECAUTIONS: General
).

 








Phenytoin/Phenobarbital


The coadministration of phenytoin or phenobarbital will not affect plasma concentrations of calcitriol, but may reduce endogenous plasma levels of 25(OH)D
 
  3by accelerating metabolism. Since blood level of calcitriol will be reduced, higher doses of calcitriol may be necessary if these drugs are administered simultaneously.

 








Thiazides


Thiazides are known to induce hypercalcemia by the reduction of calcium excretion in urine. Some reports have shown that the concomitant administration of thiazides with Calcitriol causes hypercalcemia. Therefore, precaution should be taken when coadministration is necessary.








Digitalis


Calcitriol dosage must be determined with care in patients undergoing treatment with digitalis, as hypercalcemia in such patients may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias (see
 
  
PRECAUTIONS: General
).

 








Ketoconazole


Ketoconazole may inhibit both synthetic and catabolic enzymes of calcitriol. Reductions in serum endogenous calcitriol concentrations have been observed following the administration of 300 mg/day to 1200 mg/day ketoconazole for a week to healthy men. However, in vivo drug interaction studies of ketoconazole with calcitriol have not been investigated.








Corticosteroids


A relationship of functional antagonism exists between vitamin D analogues, which promote calcium absorption, and corticosteroids, which inhibit calcium absorption.








Phosphate-Binding Agents


Since calcitriol also has an effect on phosphate transport in the intestine, kidneys and bones, the dosage of phosphate-binding agents must be adjusted in accordance with the serum phosphate concentration.








Vitamin D


Since calcitriol is the most potent active metabolite of vitamin D
 
  3, pharmacological doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during treatment with calcitriol to avoid possible additive effects and hypercalcemia (see
 
  
WARNINGS
).

 








Calcium Supplements


Uncontrolled intake of additional calcium-containing preparations should be avoided (see
 
  
PRECAUTIONS: General
).

 








Magnesium


Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, antacids) may cause hypermagnesemia and should therefore not be taken during therapy with calcitriol by patients on chronic renal dialysis.","Cholestyramine, Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Thiazides, Digitalis, Ketoconazole, Corticosteroids, Phosphate-Binding Agents, Vitamin D, Calcium Supplements, Magnesium"

Drugs that interfere with platelet aggregation: May induce bleeding (7.2)








7.1 Oral Anticoagulants


Heparin sodium may prolong the one-stage prothrombin time. Therefore, when heparin sodium is given with dicumarol or warfarin sodium, a period of at least 5 hours after the last intravenous dose or 24 hours after the last subcutaneous dose should elapse before blood is drawn, if a valid prothrombin time is to be obtained.









7.2 Platelet Inhibitors


Drugs such as NSAIDS (including salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and celecoxib), dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists (including abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban), and others that interfere with platelet-aggregation reactions (the main hemostatic defense of heparinized patients) may induce bleeding and should be used with caution in patients receiving heparin sodium. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduction in the dose of antiplatelet agent or heparin is recommended.









7.3 Other Interactions


Digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine or antihistamines may partially counteract the anticoagulant action of heparin sodium. Intravenous nitroglycerin administered to heparinized patients may result in a decrease of the partial thromboplastin time with subsequent rebound effect upon discontinuation of nitroglycerin. Careful monitoring of partial thromboplastin time and adjustment of heparin dosage are recommended during coadministration of heparin and intravenous nitroglycerin.

Antithrombin III (human) – The anticoagulant effect of heparin is enhanced by concurrent treatment with antithrombin III (human) in patients with hereditary antithrombin III deficiency. To reduce the risk of bleeding, a reduced dosage of heparin is recommended during treatment with antithrombin III (human).","dicumarol, warfarin sodium, salicylic acid, ibuprofen, indomethacin, celecoxib, dextran, phenylbutazone, thienopyridines, dipyridamole, hydroxychloroquine, abciximab, eptifibatide, tirofiban, digitalis, tetracyclines, nicotine, antihistamines, nitroglycerin, antithrombin III"

7.1 QT Prolonging Drugs

Fingolimod has not been studied in patients treated with drugs that prolong the QT interval. Drugs that prolong the QT interval have been associated with cases of torsades de pointes in patients with bradycardia. Since initiation of fingolimod treatment results in decreased heart rate and may prolong the QT interval, patients on QT prolonging drugs with a known risk of torsades de pointes (e.g., citalopram, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, methadone, erythromycin) should be monitored overnight with continuous ECG in a medical facility
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

 








7.2 Ketoconazole

The blood levels of fingolimod and fingolimod-phosphate are increased by 1.7-fold when used concomitantly with ketoconazole. Patients who use fingolimod and systemic ketoconazole concomitantly should be closely monitored, as the risk of adverse reactions is greater.








7.3 Vaccines

Fingolimod reduces the immune response to vaccination. Vaccination may be less effective during and for up to 2 months after discontinuation of treatment with fingolimod
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Avoid the use of live attenuated vaccines during and for 2 months after treatment with fingolimod because of the risk of infection. It is recommended that pediatric patients, if possible, be brought up to date with all immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines prior to initiating fingolimod therapy.

 








7.4 Antineoplastic, Immunosuppressive, or Immune-Modulating Therapies

Antineoplastic, immune-modulating, or immunosuppressive therapies, (including corticosteroids) are expected to increase the risk of immunosuppression, and the risk of additive immune system effects must be considered if these therapies are coadministered with fingolimod. When switching from drugs with prolonged immune effects, such as natalizumab, teriflunomide or mitoxantrone, the duration and mode of action of these drugs must be considered to avoid unintended additive immunosuppressive effects when initiating fingolimod
 
  [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

 








7.5 Drugs That Slow Heart Rate or Atrioventricular Conduction (e.g., beta blockers or diltiazem)

Experience with fingolimod in patients receiving concurrent therapy with drugs that slow the heart rate or AV conduction (e.g., beta blockers, digoxin, or heart rate-slowing calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem or verapamil) is limited. Because initiation of fingolimod treatment may result in an additional decrease in heart rate, concomitant use of these drugs during fingolimod initiation may be associated with severe bradycardia or heart block. Seek advice from the physician prescribing these drugs regarding the possibility to switch to drugs that do not slow the heart rate or atrioventricular conduction before initiating fingolimod. Patients who cannot switch should have overnight continuous ECG monitoring after the first dose
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

 








7.6 Laboratory Test Interaction

Because fingolimod reduces blood lymphocyte counts via redistribution in secondary lymphoid organs, peripheral blood lymphocyte counts cannot be utilized to evaluate the lymphocyte subset status of a patient treated with fingolimod. A recent CBC should be available before initiating treatment with fingolimod.","Systemic Ketoconazole,Vaccines,citalopram,chlorpromazine,haloperidol,methadone,erythromycin,ketoconazole,natalizumab,teriflunomide,mitoxantrone,beta blockers,digoxin,diltiazem,verapamil"

Hepatic enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone, rifampin) can increase valproate clearance, while enzyme inhibitors (e.g., felbamate) can decrease valproate clearance. Therefore increased monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations and dosage adjustment are indicated whenever enzyme-inducing or inhibiting drugs are introduced or withdrawn (

7.1 Effects of Co-Administered Drugs on Valproate Clearance

Drugs that affect the level of expression of hepatic enzymes, particularly those that elevate levels of glucuronosyltransferases (such as ritonavir), may increase the clearance of valproate. For example, phenytoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital (or primidone) can double the clearance of valproate. Thus, patients on monotherapy will generally have longer half-lives and higher concentrations than patients receiving polytherapy with antiepilepsy drugs.
In contrast, drugs that are inhibitors of cytochrome P450 isozymes, e.g., antidepressants, may be expected to have little effect on valproate clearance because cytochrome P450 microsomal mediated oxidation is a relatively minor secondary metabolic pathway compared to glucuronidation and beta-oxidation.
Because of these changes in valproate clearance, monitoring of valproate and concomitant drug concentrations should be increased whenever enzyme inducing drugs are introduced or withdrawn.
The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of several commonly prescribed medications on valproate pharmacokinetics. The list is not exhaustive nor could it be, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important interaction has been observed


Aspirin

A study involving the co-administration of aspirin at antipyretic doses (11 to 16 mg/kg) with valproate to pediatric patients (n=6) revealed a decrease in protein binding and an inhibition of metabolism of valproate. Valproate free fraction was increased 4-fold in the presence of aspirin compared to valproate alone. The β-oxidation pathway consisting of 2-E-valproic acid, 3-OH-valproic acid, and 3-keto valproic acid was decreased from 25% of total metabolites excreted on valproate alone to 8.3% in the presence of aspirin. Whether or not the interaction observed in this study applies to adults is unknown, but caution should be observed if valproate and aspirin are to be co-administered.

Carbapenem Antibiotics

A clinically significant reduction in serum valproic acid concentration has been reported in patients receiving carbapenem antibiotics (for example, ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem; this is not a complete list) and may result in loss of seizure control. The mechanism of this interaction is not well understood. Serum valproic acid concentrations should be monitored frequently after initiating carbapenem therapy. Alternative antibacterial or anticonvulsant therapy should be considered if serum valproic acid concentrations drop significantly or seizure control deteriorates
 
  [see
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]
 
  .

 

Estrogen-Containing Hormonal Contraceptives

Estrogen-containing hormonal contraceptives may increase the clearance of valproate, which may result in decreased concentration of valproate and potentially increased seizure frequency. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing estrogen containing products.

Felbamate

A study involving the co-administration of 1,200 mg/day of felbamate with valproate to patients with epilepsy (n=10) revealed an increase in mean valproate peak concentration by 35% (from 86 mcg/mL to 115 mcg/mL) compared to valproate alone. Increasing the felbamate dose to 2,400 mg/day increased the mean valproate peak concentration to 133 mcg/mL (another 16% increase). A decrease in valproate dosage may be necessary when felbamate therapy is initiated.

Methotrexate

Methotrexate may decrease serum valproate levels and potentially result in increased frequency of seizures or bipolar symptoms. Prescribers should monitor serum valproate concentrations and clinical response when adding or discontinuing methotrexate and adjust valproate dosage, if necessary.

Rifampin

A study involving the administration of a single-dose of valproate (7 mg/kg) 36 hours after 5 nights of daily dosing with rifampin (600 mg) revealed a 40% increase in the oral clearance of valproate. Valproate dosage adjustment may be necessary when it is co-administered with rifampin.








7.2 Effects of Valproate on Other Drugs

Valproate has been found to be a weak inhibitor of some P450 isozymes, epoxide hydrase, and glucuronosyltransferases.
The following list provides information about the potential for an influence of valproate co-administration on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of several commonly prescribed medications. The list is not exhaustive, since new interactions are continuously being reported.

Drugs for which a potentially important valproate interaction has been observed


Amitriptyline/Nortriptyline

Administration of a single oral 50 mg dose of amitriptyline to 15 normal volunteers (10 males and 5 females) who received valproate (500 mg BID) resulted in a 21% decrease in plasma clearance of amitriptyline and a 34% decrease in the net clearance of nortriptyline. Rare post-marketing reports of concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline resulting in an increased amitriptyline level have been received. Concurrent use of valproate and amitriptyline has rarely been associated with toxicity. Monitoring of amitriptyline levels should be considered for patients taking valproate concomitantly with amitriptyline. Consideration should be given to lowering the dose of amitriptyline/nortriptyline in the presence of valproate.

Carbamazepine/carbamazepine-10,11-Epoxide

Serum levels of carbamazepine (CBZ) decreased 17% while that of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) increased by 45% upon co-administration of valproate and CBZ to epileptic patients.

Clonazepam

The concomitant use of valproate and clonazepam may induce absence status in patients with a history of absence type seizures.

Diazepam

Valproate displaces diazepam from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (1,500 mg daily) increased the free fraction of diazepam (10 mg) by 90% in healthy volunteers (n=6). Plasma clearance and volume of distribution for free diazepam were reduced by 25% and 20%, respectively, in the presence of valproate. The elimination half-life of diazepam remained unchanged upon addition of valproate.

Ethosuximide

Valproate inhibits the metabolism of ethosuximide. Administration of a single ethosuximide dose of 500 mg with valproate (800 mg/day to 1,600 mg/day) to healthy volunteers (n=6) was accompanied by a 25% increase in elimination half-life of ethosuximide and a 15% decrease in its total clearance as compared to ethosuximide alone. Patients receiving valproate and ethosuximide, especially along with other anticonvulsants, should be monitored for alterations in serum concentrations of both drugs.

Lamotrigine

In a steady-state study involving 10 healthy volunteers, the elimination half-life of lamotrigine increased from 26 to 70 hours with valproate co-administration (a 165% increase). The dose of lamotrigine should be reduced when co-administered with valproate. Serious skin reactions (such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) have been reported with concomitant lamotrigine and valproate administration. See lamotrigine package insert for details on lamotrigine dosing with concomitant valproate administration.

Phenobarbital

Valproate was found to inhibit the metabolism of phenobarbital. Co-administration of valproate (250 mg BID for 14 days) with phenobarbital to normal subjects (n=6) resulted in a 50% increase in half-life and a 30% decrease in plasma clearance of phenobarbital (60 mg single-dose). The fraction of phenobarbital dose excreted unchanged increased by 50% in presence of valproate.
There is evidence for severe CNS depression, with or without significant elevations of barbiturate or valproate serum concentrations. All patients receiving concomitant barbiturate therapy should be closely monitored for neurological toxicity. Serum barbiturate concentrations should be obtained, if possible, and the barbiturate dosage decreased, if appropriate.
Primidone, which is metabolized to a barbiturate, may be involved in a similar interaction with valproate.

Phenytoin

Valproate displaces phenytoin from its plasma albumin binding sites and inhibits its hepatic metabolism. Co-administration of valproate (400 mg TID) with phenytoin (250 mg) in normal volunteers (n=7) was associated with a 60% increase in the free fraction of phenytoin. Total plasma clearance and apparent volume of distribution of phenytoin increased 30% in the presence of valproate. Both the clearance and apparent volume of distribution of free phenytoin were reduced by 25%.
In patients with epilepsy, there have been reports of breakthrough seizures occurring with the combination of valproate and phenytoin. The dosage of phenytoin should be adjusted as required by the clinical situation.

Propofol

The concomitant use of valproate and propofol may lead to increased blood levels of propofol. Reduce the dose of propofol when co-administering with valproate. Monitor patients closely for signs of increased sedation or cardiorespiratory depression.

Rufinamide

Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, rufinamide clearance was decreased by valproate. Rufinamide concentrations were increased by <16% to 70%, dependent on concentration of valproate (with the larger increases being seen in pediatric patients at high doses or concentrations of valproate). Patients stabilized on rufinamide before being prescribed valproate should begin valproate therapy at a low dose and titrate to a clinically effective dose
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)]
 
  . Similarly, patients on valproate should begin at a rufinamide dose lower than 10 mg/kg per day (pediatric patients) or 400 mg per day (adults).

 

Tolbutamide

From
 
  in vitroexperiments, the unbound fraction of tolbutamide was increased from 20% to 50% when added to plasma samples taken from patients treated with valproate. The clinical relevance of this displacement is unknown.

 

Warfarin

In an
 
  in vitrostudy, valproate increased the unbound fraction of warfarin by up to 32.6%. The therapeutic relevance of this is unknown; however, coagulation tests should be monitored if valproate therapy is instituted in patients taking anticoagulants.

 

Zidovudine

In six patients who were seropositive for HIV, the clearance of zidovudine (100 mg q8h) was decreased by 38% after administration of valproate (250 mg or 500 mg q8h); the half-life of zidovudine was unaffected.








7.3 Topiramate

Concomitant administration of valproate and topiramate has been associated with hyperammonemia with and without encephalopathy
 
  [see 
  
   Contraindications (4) 
 
  and 
 
  
Warnings and Precautions (5.6, 
  
   5.9, 
  
   5.10)]
 
  . Concomitant administration of topiramate with valproate has also been associated with hypothermia in patients who have tolerated either drug alone. It may be prudent to examine blood ammonia levels in patients in whom the onset of hypothermia has been reported
 
  [see 
  
   Warnings and Precautions (5.9, 
  
   5.11)]
 
  .

 








7.4 Cannabidiol

Concomitant administration of valproate and cannabidiol has been associated with an increased risk of ALT and/or AST elevation. This has been manageable by dose reduction or, in more severe cases, by discontinuation of one or both drugs. Liver function, including serum transaminase and total bilirubin levels, should be monitored during concomitant treatment

Lisinopril attenuates potassium loss caused by thiazide-type diuretics. Potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene, and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, monitor the patient's serum potassium frequently.







7.2 Antidiabetics

Concomitant administration of lisinopril and antidiabetic medicines (insulins, oral hypoglycemic agents) may cause an increased blood-glucose-lowering effect with risk of hypoglycemia.







7.3 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents Including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving lisinopril and NSAID therapy.
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including lisinopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.







7.4 Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy.
The VA NEPHRON trial enrolled 1448 patients with type 2 diabetes, elevated urinary-albumin-to-creatinine ratio, and decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR 30 to 89.9 ml/min), randomized them to lisinopril or placebo on a background of losartan therapy and followed them for a median of 2.2 years. Patients receiving the combination of losartan and lisinopril did not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy for the combined endpoint of decline in GFR, end state renal disease, or death, but experienced an increased incidence of hyperkalemia and acute kidney injury compared with the monotherapy group.
In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on lisinopril and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not co-administer aliskiren with lisinopril in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with lisinopril in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min).







7.5 Lithium

Lithium toxicity has been reported in patients receiving lithium concomitantly with drugs, which cause elimination of sodium, including ACE inhibitors. Lithium toxicity was usually reversible upon discontinuation of lithium and the ACE inhibitor. Monitor serum lithium levels during concurrent use.







7.6 Gold

Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including lisinopril.







7.7 mTOR Inhibitors

Patients taking concomitant mTOR inhibitor (e.g. temsirolimus, sirolimus, everolimus) therapy may be at increased risk for angioedema.
 
  [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (

Docetaxel is a CYP3A4 substrate. In vitro studies have shown that the metabolism of docetaxel may be modified by the concomitant administration of compounds that induce, inhibit, or are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4.
In vivo studies showed that the exposure of docetaxel increased 2.2-fold when it was coadministered with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4. Protease inhibitors, particularly ritonavir, may increase the exposure of docetaxel. Concomitant use of Docetaxel Injection and drugs that inhibit CYP3A4 may increase exposure to docetaxel and should be avoided. In patients receiving treatment with Docetaxel Injection close monitoring for toxicity and a Docetaxel Injection dose reduction could be considered if systemic administration of a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor cannot be avoided [see Dosage and Administration (2.7), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Ramelteon Tablets


Fluvoxamine (strong CYP1A2 inhibitor)

AUC0-inf for ramelteon increased approximately 190-fold, and the Cmax increased approximately 70-fold upon coadministration of fluvoxamine and ramelteon tablets, compared to ramelteon tablets administered alone. Ramelteon tablets should not be used in combination with fluvoxamine [see Contraindications (4), Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Other less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors have not been adequately studied. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution to patients taking less strong CYP1A2 inhibitors.

Rifampin (strong CYP enzyme inducer)

Administration of multiple doses of rifampin resulted in a mean decrease of approximately 80% in total exposure to ramelteon and metabolite M-II. Efficacy may be reduced when ramelteon tablets are used in combination with strong CYP enzyme inducers such as rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].


Ketoconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor)

The AUC0-inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 84% and 36% upon coadministration of ketoconazole with ramelteon tablets. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Fluconazole (strong CYP2C9 inhibitor)

The AUC0-inf and Cmax of ramelteon was increased by approximately 150% when ramelteon was coadministered with fluconazole. Ramelteon tablets should be administered with caution in subjects taking strong CYP2C9 inhibitors such as fluconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (

Donepezil

The AUC0-inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 100% and 87%, respectively upon coadministration of donepezil with ramelteon tablets. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with donepezil [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].

Doxepin

The AUC0-inf and Cmax of ramelteon increased by approximately 66% and 69%, respectively, upon coadministration of doxepin with ramelteon tablets. Patients should be closely monitored when ramelteon tablets are coadministered with doxepin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)].








7.2  Effect of Alcohol on Ramelteon Tablets

Alcohol by itself impairs performance and can cause sleepiness. Since the intended effect of ramelteon is to promote sleep, patients should be cautioned not to consume alcohol when using ramelteon tablets [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. Use of the products in combination may have an additive effect.








7.3  Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions

Ramelteon tablets are not known to interfere with commonly used clinical laboratory tests.

CNS Depressants
- Promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP may increase, prolong, or intensify the sedative action of other central-nervous-system depressants, such as alcohol, sedatives/hypnotics (including barbiturates), narcotics, narcotic analgesics, general anesthetics, tricyclic antidepressants, and tranquilizers; therefore, such agents should be avoided or administered in reduced dosage to patients receiving promethazine hydrochloride. When given concomitantly with promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP the dose of barbiturates should be reduced by at least one-half, and the dose of narcotics should be reduced by one-quarter to one-half. Dosage must be individualized. Excessive amounts of promethazine hydrochloride relative to a narcotic may lead to restlessness and motor hyperactivity in the patient with pain; these symptoms usually disappear with adequate control of the pain.

 


Epinephrine
- Because of the potential for promethazine hydrochloride to reverse epinephrine's vasopressor effect, epinephrine should NOT be used to treat hypotension associated with promethazine hydrochloride tablets, USP overdose.

 


Anticholinergics
- Concomitant use of other agents with anticholinergic properties should be undertaken with caution.

When probenecid is used to elevate plasma concentrations of penicillin or other betalactams, or when such drugs are given to patients taking probenecid therapeutically, high plasma concentrations of the other drug may increase the incidence of adverse reactions associated with that drug. In the case of penicillin or other beta-lactams, psychic disturbances have been reported.
The use of salicylates antagonizes the uricosuric action of probenecid (see 
WARNINGS
). The uricosuric action of probenecid is also antagonized by pyrazinamide.
Probenecid produces an insignificant increase in free sulfonamide plasma concentrations but a significant increase in total sulfonamide plasma levels. Since probenecid decreases the renal excretion of conjugated sulfonamides, plasma concentrations of the latter should be determined from time to time when a sulfonamide and probenecid are coadministered for prolonged periods. Probenecid may prolong or enhance the action of oral sulfonylureas and thereby increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
It has been reported that patients receiving probenecid require significantly less thiopental for induction of anesthesia. In addition, ketamine and thiopental anesthesia were significantly prolonged in rats receiving probenecid.
The concomitant administration of probenecid increases the mean plasma elimination half-life of a number of drugs which can lead to increased plasma concentrations. These include agents such as indomethacin, acetaminophen, naproxen, ketoprofen, meclofenamate, lorazepam, and rifampin. Although the clinical significance of this observation has not been established, a lower dosage of the drug may be required to produce a therapeutic effect, and increases in dosage of the drug in question should be made cautiously and in small increments when probenecid is being co-administered. Although specific instances of toxicity due to this potential interaction have not been observed to date, physicians should be alert to this possibility.
Probenecid given concomitantly with sulindac had only a slight effect on plasma sulfide levels, while plasma levels of sulindac and sulfone were increased. Sulindac was shown to produce a modest reduction in the uricosuric action of probenecid, which probably is not significant under most circumstances.
In animals and in humans, probenecid has been reported to increase plasma concentrations of methotrexate (see 
WARNINGS
).
Falsely high readings for theophylline have been reported in an in vitro study, using the Schack and Waxler technic, when therapeutic concentrations of theophylline and probenecid were added to human plasma.","probenecid, penicillin, beta-lactams, salicylates, pyrazinamide, sulfonamide, sulfonylureas, thiopental, ketamine, indomethacin, acetaminophen, naproxen, ketoprofen, meclofenamate, lorazepam, rifampin, sulindac, methotrexate, theophylline"

Clozapine is a substrate for many cytochrome P450 isozymes, in particular CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6. Use caution when administering clozapine concomitantly with drugs that are inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes.









CYP1A2 Inhibitors


Concomitant use of clozapine and CYP1A2 inhibitors can increase plasma levels of clozapine, potentially resulting in adverse reactions. Reduce the clozapine dose to one-third of the original dose when clozapine is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 inhibitors (e.g., fluvoxamine, ciprofloxacin, or enoxacin). The clozapine dose should be increased to the original dose when coadministration of strong CYP1A2 inhibitors is discontinued

Concomitant treatment with clozapine and CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine, escitalopram, erythromycin, paroxetine, bupropion, fluoxetine, quinidine, duloxetine, terbinafine, or sertraline) can increase clozapine levels and lead to adverse reactions
 
  [see
  
   Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
 
  . Use caution and monitor patients closely when using such inhibitors. Consider reducing the clozapine dose
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)]
 
  .

 











CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 Inducers


Concomitant treatment with drugs that induce CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 can decrease the plasma concentration of clozapine, resulting in decreased effectiveness of clozapine. Tobacco smoke is a moderate inducer of CYP1A2. Strong CYP3A4 inducers include carbamazepine, phenytoin, St. John's wort, and rifampin. It may be necessary to increase the clozapine dose if used concomitantly with inducers of these enzymes. However, concomitant use of clozapine and strong CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
 
  

Consider reducing the clozapine dosage when discontinuing coadministered enzyme inducers; because discontinuation of inducers can result in increased clozapine plasma levels and an increased risk of adverse reactions
 
  [see
  
   Dosage and Administration (2.6)].
 
  












Anticholinergic Drugs


Concomitant treatment with clozapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g., benztropine, cyclobenzaprine, diphenhydramine) can increase the risk for anticholinergic toxicity and severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Avoid concomitant use of clozapine with anticholinergic drugs when possible

Cyclosporine or Gemfibrozil






Clinical Impact:



Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR and cyclosporine, an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and OATP1B1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Gemfibrozil may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with LIPITOR. 





Intervention:



Concomitant use of cyclosporine or gemfibrozil with LIPITOR is not recommended.





Anti-Viral Medications






Clinical Impact:



Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR with many anti-viral medications, which are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and/or transporters (e.g., BCRP, OATP1B1/1B3, P-gp, MRP2, and/or OAT2) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir with LIPITOR.





Intervention:





•Concomitant use of tipranavir plus ritonavir or glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir with LIPITOR is not recommended. 

•In patients taking lopinavir plus ritonavir, or simeprevir, consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use with atorvastatin.

Select Azole Antifungals or Macrolide Antibiotics






Clinical Impact:



Atorvastatin plasma levels were significantly increased with concomitant administration of LIPITOR with select azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics, due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and/or transporters [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Intervention:



In patients taking clarithromycin or itraconazole, do not exceed LIPITOR 20 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of other azole antifungals or macrolide antibiotics with LIPITOR.

Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been observed with concomitant use of lipid modifying dosages of niacin (≥1 gram/day niacin) with LIPITOR.





Intervention:



Consider if the benefit of using lipid modifying dosages of niacin concomitantly with LIPITOR outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.





Fibrates (other than Gemfibrozil)






Clinical Impact:



Fibrates may cause myopathy when given alone. The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is increased with concomitant use of fibrates with LIPITOR.





Intervention:



Consider if the benefit of using fibrates concomitantly with LIPITOR outweighs the increased risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.





Colchicine






Clinical Impact:



Cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis have been reported with concomitant use of colchicine with LIPITOR.





Intervention:



Consider the risk/benefit of concomitant use of colchicine with LIPITOR. If concomitant use is decided, monitor patients for signs and symptoms of myopathy particularly during initiation of therapy and during upward dose titration of either drug.





Grapefruit Juice






Clinical Impact:



Grapefruit juice consumption, especially excessive consumption, more than 1.2 liters/daily, can raise the plasma levels of atorvastatin and may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. 





Intervention:



Avoid intake of large quantities of grapefruit juice, more than 1.2 liters daily, when taking LIPITOR. 




 








7.2	Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to LIPITOR 

Table 3 presents drug interactions that may decrease exposure to LIPITOR and instructions for preventing or managing them.

Table 3: Drug Interactions that may Decrease Exposure to LIPITOR






Rifampin






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant administration of LIPITOR with rifampin, an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 and inhibitor of OATP1B1, can lead to variable reductions in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Due to the dual interaction mechanism of rifampin, delayed administration of LIPITOR after administration of rifampin has been associated with a significant reduction in atorvastatin plasma concentrations.





Intervention:



Administer LIPITOR and rifampin simultaneously.




 








7.3	LIPITOR Effects on Other Drugs 

Table 4 presents LIPITOR’s effect on other drugs and instructions for preventing or managing them.

Table 4: LIPITOR Effects on Other Drugs






Oral Contraceptives






Clinical Impact:



Co-administration of LIPITOR and an oral contraceptive increased plasma concentrations of norethindrone and ethinyl estradiol [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].






Intervention:



Consider this when selecting an oral contraceptive for patients taking LIPITOR.





Digoxin






Clinical Impact:



When multiple doses of LIPITOR and digoxin were co-administered, steady state plasma digoxin concentrations increased [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 






Intervention:



Monitor patients taking digoxin appropriately.Drug Interactions



Atorvastatin is a substrate of the hepatic transporters, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 transporter. Metabolites of atorvastatin are substrates of OATP1B1. Atorvastatin is also identified as a substrate of the efflux transporter BCRP, which may limit the intestinal absorption and biliary clearance of atorvastatin.

7.1 Antiepileptic Drugs

Concomitant administration of phenytoin or carbamazepine with topiramate resulted in a clinically significant decrease in plasma concentrations of topiramate when compared to topiramate given alone. A dosage adjustment may be needed
 
  [see Dosage and Administration (
  
   2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)].

7.2 Other Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors

Concomitant use of topiramate, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, with any other carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g., zonisamide or acetazolamide) may increase the severity of metabolic acidosis and may also increase the risk of kidney stone formation. Therefore, patients given topiramate  concomitantly with another carbonic anhydrase inhibitor should be monitored particularly closely for the appearance or worsening of metabolic acidosis
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  .

 







7.3 CNS Depressants

Concomitant administration of topiramate and alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs has not been evaluated in clinical studies. Because of the potential of topiramate to cause CNS depression, as well as other cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric adverse reactions, topiramate should be used with extreme caution if used in combination with alcohol and other CNS depressants.







7.4 Contraceptives

The possibility of decreased contraceptive efficacy and increased breakthrough bleeding may occur in patients taking contraceptive products with topiramate. Patients taking estrogen-containing or progestin-only contraceptives should be asked to report any change in their bleeding patterns. Contraceptive efficacy can be decreased even in the absence of breakthrough bleeding

7.6 Pioglitazone

A decrease in the exposure of pioglitazone and its active metabolites were noted with the concurrent use of pioglitazone and topiramate in a clinical trial. The clinical relevance of these observations is unknown; however, when topiramate is added to pioglitazone therapy or pioglitazone is added to topiramate therapy, careful attention should be given to the routine monitoring of patients for adequate control of their diabetic disease state

Octreotide has been associated with alterations in nutrient absorption, so it may have an effect on absorption of orally administered drugs.









								7.5     Drug Metabolism Interactions
							

Limited published data indicate that somatostatin analogs may decrease the metabolic clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, which may be due to the suppression of growth hormone. Since it cannot be excluded that octreotide may have this effect, other drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A4 and which have a low therapeutic index (e.g., quinidine, terfenadine) should therefore be used with caution.

Rev. 11/19
 
Rx Only",DI,"Drug Interactions:



Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)

Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors.
Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function and electrolytes in patients on captopril tablets and other agents that block the RAS.
Do not co-administer aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with captopril tablets in patients with renal impairment (GFR < 60 ml/min).

Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors):In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving captopril and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including captopril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs.

 

Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy: Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, as well as those on severe dietary salt restriction or dialysis, may occasionally experience a precipitous reduction of blood pressure usually within the first hour after receiving the initial dose of captopril.

 
The possibility of hypotensive effects with captopril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake approximately one week prior to initiation of treatment with captopril tablets or initiating therapy with small doses (6.25 or 12.5 mg). Alternatively, provide medical supervision for at least one hour after the initial dose. If hypotension occurs, the patient should be placed in a supine position and, if necessary, receive an intravenous infusion of normal saline. This transient hypotensive response is not a contraindication to further doses which can be given without difficulty once the blood pressure has increased after volume expansion.

Agents Having Vasodilator Activity: Data on the effect of concomitant use of other vasodilators in patients receiving captopril tablets for heart failure are not available; therefore, nitroglycerin or other nitrates (as used for management of angina) or other drugs having vasodilator activity should, if possible, be discontinued before starting captopril tablets. If resumed during captopril tablets therapy, such agents should be administered cautiously, and perhaps at lower dosage.

 

Agents Causing Renin Release: Captopril’s effect will be augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release. For example, diuretics (e.g., thiazides) may activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

 

Agents Affecting Sympathetic Activity: The sympathetic nervous system may be especially important in supporting blood pressure in patients receiving captopril alone or with diuretics. Therefore, agents affecting sympathetic activity (e.g., ganglionic blocking agents or adrenergic neuron blocking agents) should be used with caution. Beta-adrenergic blocking drugs add some further antihypertensive effect to captopril, but the overall response is less than additive.

 

Agents Increasing Serum Potassium: Since captopril decreases aldosterone production, elevation of serum potassium may occur. Potassium-sparing diuretics such as spironolactone, triamterene, or amiloride, or potassium supplements should be given only for documented hypokalemia, and then with caution, since they may lead to a significant increase of serum potassium. Salt substitutes containing potassium should also be used with caution.

 

Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, it may increase the risk of lithium toxicity.

 

Cardiac Glycosides: In a study of young healthy male subjects no evidence of a direct pharmacokinetic captopril-digoxin interaction could be found.

 

Loop Diuretics: Furosemide administered concurrently with captopril does not alter the pharmacokinetics of captopril in renally impaired hypertensive patients.

 

Allopurinol:In a study of healthy male volunteers no significant pharmacokinetic interaction occurred when captopril and allopurinol were administered concomitantly for 6 days.

 

Neprilysin Inhibitor:Patients taking concomitant neprilysin inhibitors may be at increased risk for angioedema (see

7.1 Effects of Other Drugs on Methotrexate 


Drugs that Increase Methotrexate Exposure

Coadministration of methotrexate with the following products may increase methotrexate plasma concentrations, which may increase the risk of methotrexate severe adverse reactions. In some cases, the coadministration of methotrexate with these products may also subsequently reduce active metabolite formation, which may decrease the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate. Increased organ specific adverse reactions may also occur when methotrexate is coadministered with hepatotoxic or nephrotoxic products.
If coadministration cannot be avoided, monitor closely for methotrexate adverse reactions when coadministered with:








•Oral antibiotics (including neomycin)

•Oral or intravenous penicillin orsulfonamide antibiotics

•Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g., oral anticoagulants, phenytoin, salicylates, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, and tetracyclines)

•Probenecid





•Antifolate drugs (e.g., dapsone, pemetrexed, pyrimethamine and sulfonamides)

•Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

•Hepatotoxic products

•Proton pump inhibitors

•Weak acids (e.g., salicylates)

•Nephrotoxic products






Nitrous Oxide 

Coadministration of methotrexate with nitrous oxide anesthesia potentiates the effect of methotrexate on folate-dependent metabolic pathways, which may increase the risk of severe methotrexate adverse reactions. Avoid nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients receiving methotrexate. Consider alternative therapies in patients who have received prior nitrous oxide anesthesia.

Folic Acid

Coadministration of methotrexate with folic acid or its derivatives decreases the clinical effectiveness of methotrexate in patients with neoplastic diseases. Methotrexate competes with reduced folates for active transport across cell membranes.

Food


Isoniazid should not be administered with food. Studies have shown that the bioavailability of isoniazid is reduced significantly when administered with food. Tyramine- and histamine-containing foods should be avoided in patients receiving isoniazid. Because isoniazid has some monoamine oxidase inhibiting activity, an interaction with tyramine-containing foods (cheese, red wine) may occur. Diamine oxidase may also be inhibited, causing exaggerated response (e.g., headache, sweating, palpitations, flushing, hypotension) to foods containing histamine (e.g., skipjack, tuna, other tropical fish).








Acetaminophen



A report of severe acetaminophen toxicity was reported in a patient receiving isoniazid. It is believed that the toxicity may have resulted from a previously unrecognized interaction between isoniazid and acetaminophen and a molecular basis for this interaction has been proposed. However, current evidence suggests that isoniazid does induce P-450IIE1, a mixed-function oxidase enzyme that appears to generate the toxic metabolites, in the liver. Furthermore it has been proposed that isoniazid resulted in induction of P-450IIE1 in the patient’s liver which, in turn, resulted in a greater proportion of the ingested acetaminophen being converted to the toxic metabolites. Studies have demonstrated that pretreatment with isoniazid potentiates acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in rats
           
 
  1,2.
          

 










Carbamazepine



Isoniazid is known to slow the metabolism of carbamazepine and increase its serum levels. Carbamazepine levels should be determined prior to concurrent administration with isoniazid, signs and symptoms of carbamazepine toxicity should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made
           
 
  3.
          

 










Ketoconazole



Potential interaction of ketoconazole and isoniazid may exist. When ketoconazole is given in combination with isoniazid and rifampin the AUC of ketoconazole is decreased by as much as 88 percent after 5 months of concurrent isoniazid and rifampin therapy
           
 
  4.
          

 










Phenytoin



Isoniazid may increase serum levels of phenytoin. To avoid phenytoin intoxication, appropriate adjustment of the anticonvulsant should be made
           
 
  5,6.
          

 










Theophylline



A recent study has shown that concomitant administration of isoniazid and theophylline may cause elevated plasma levels of theophylline and in some instances a slight decrease in the elimination of isoniazid. Since the therapeutic range of theophylline is narrow, theophylline serum levels should be monitored closely and appropriate dosage adjustments of theophylline should be made
           
 
  7.
          

 










Valproate



A recent case study has shown a possible increase in the plasma level of valproate when co-administered with isoniazid. Plasma valproate concentration should be monitored when isoniazid and valproate are co-administered and appropriate dosage adjustments of valproate should be made

Antiretrovirals





Clinical Impact:


The effect of PPIs on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known.
          
    
     

Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with pantoprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance.
Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with pantoprazole may increase toxicity of the antiretroviral drugs
            
      
       .

There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with pantoprazole.

     Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information.
          
    
     




Warfarin





Clinical Impact:


Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death.
          
    
     




Intervention:


Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. 
          
    
     




Clopidogrel


 
          
    
     




Clinical Impact:


Concomitant administration of pantoprazole and clopidogrel in healthy subjects had no clinically important effect on exposure to the active metabolite of clopidogrel or clopidogrel-induced platelet inhibition 
          
    
     [see 
           
     
      Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 
          
    
     





Intervention:


No dose adjustment of clopidogrel is necessary when administered with an approved dose of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets. 
          
    
     




Methotrexate





Clinical Impact:


Concomitant use of PPIs with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of high-dose methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted 
          
    
     [see

Intervention:


A temporary withdrawal of pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may be considered in some patients receiving high-dose methotrexate.
          
    
     




Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole/itraconazole)





Clinical Impact:


Pantoprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity.
          
    
     




Intervention:


Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of pantoprazole sodium in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH 
          
    
     [see 
           
     
      Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]
          
    
     . The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF.
          
    
      
          
    
     See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption.
          
    
     




Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors





Clinical Impact:



CgA levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors 
          
    
     [see 
           
     
      Warnings and Precautions (5.11),  
           
     
      Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]
          
    
     . 
          
    
     




Intervention:


Temporarily stop pantoprazole sodium delayed-release tablets treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. 
          
    
     




False Positive Urine Tests for THC





Clinical Impact:


There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs 
          
    
     [see 
           
     
      Warnings and Precautions (5.12)]
          
    
     .

Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated.
Amoxicillin also has drug interactions.





Intervention:



See Contraindications, Warnings and Precautions in prescribing information for clarithromycin.
See Drug Interactions in prescribing information for amoxicillin.





Tacrolimus






Clinical Impact:



Potential for increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19.





Intervention:



Monitor tacrolimus whole blood concentrations. Dose adjustment may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus.





Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors






Clinical Impact:



Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors 
           
     
      [see Warnings and Precautions (

5.11

), Clinical Pharmacology (
            
      
       12.2)].
           
     
      






Intervention:



Temporarily stop omeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g., for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary.





Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test






Clinical Impact:



Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma.





Intervention:



Temporarily stop omeprazole treatment at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline 
           
     
      [see Clinical Pharmacology (
            
      
       12.2)].
           
     
      






False Positive Urine Tests for THC






Clinical Impact:



There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs.





Intervention:



An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.





Other






Clinical Impact:



There have been clinical reports of interactions with other drugs metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system (e.g., cyclosporine, disulfiram).





Intervention:



Monitor patients to determine if it is necessary to adjust the dosage of these other drugs when taken concomitantly with omeprazole.

  Table 3 Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Ezetimibe 





 Cyclosporine 





Clinical Impact 


 Concomitant use of ezetimibe and cyclosporine increases ezetimibe and cyclosporine concentrations. The degree of increase in ezetimibe exposure may be greater in patients with severe renal insufficiency [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 




Intervention 


 Monitor cyclosporine concentrations in patients receiving ezetimibe and cyclosporine. In patients treated with cyclosporine, weigh the potential effects of the increased exposure to ezetimibe from concomitant use against the benefits of alterations in lipid levels provided by ezetimibe. 




 Fibrates 





Clinical Impact 


 Both fenofibrate and ezetimibe may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. Co-administration of ezetimibe with fibrates other than fenofibrate is not recommended [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . 




Intervention 


 If cholelithiasis is suspected in a patient receiving ezetimibe and fenofibrate, gallbladder studies are indicated, and alternative lipid-lowering therapy should be considered. 




 Bile Acid Sequestrants 





Clinical Impact 


 Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean exposure of total ezetimibe. This may result in a reduction of efficacy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

7.1 Use with Other Drugs for Smoking Cessation

Safety and efficacy of varenicline tablets in combination with other smoking cessation therapies have not been studied.  

Bupropion 

 
Varenicline (1 mg twice daily) did not alter the steady-state pharmacokinetics of bupropion (150 mg twice daily) in 46 smokers. The safety of the combination of bupropion and varenicline has not been established.  

Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) 

 
Although co-administration of varenicline (1 mg twice daily) and transdermal nicotine (21 mg/day) for up to 12 days did not affect nicotine pharmacokinetics, the incidence of nausea, headache, vomiting, dizziness, dyspepsia, and fatigue was greater for the combination than for NRT alone. In this study, eight of twenty-two (36%) patients treated with the combination of varenicline and NRT prematurely discontinued treatment due to adverse events, compared to 1 of 17 (6%) of patients treated with NRT and placebo.








7.2 Effect of Smoking Cessation on Other Drugs

Diuretics: Possibility of excessive hypotension (7.1). 
Lithium: Use with caution (7.4).
Gold: Nitritoid reactions have been reported (7.5). 
NSAIDS use may lead to increased risk of renal impairment and loss of antihypertensive effect (7.6). 
mTOR inhibitor or neprilysin inhibitor use may increase angioedema risk (7.7).






7.1 Diuretics

Patients on diuretics, especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with ramipril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with ramipril can be minimized by either decreasing or discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with ramipril. If this is not possible, reduce the starting dose [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION (2)]. 







7.2 Agents Increasing Serum Potassium

Coadministration of ramipril with other drugs that raise serum potassium levels may result in hyperkalemia. Monitor serum potassium in such patients.







7.3 Other Agents Affecting RAS

In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. [see WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS (5.7)]. Do not co-administer aliskiren with ramipril in patients with diabetes [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4)].








7.4 Lithium

Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium; therefore, frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased. 







7.5 Gold

Nitritoid reactions (symptoms include facial flushing, nausea, vomiting and hypotension) have been reported rarely in patients on therapy with injectable gold (sodium aurothiomalate) and concomitant ACE inhibitor therapy including ramipril. 







7.6 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents including Selective Cyclooxygenase-2 Inhibitors (COX-2 Inhibitors)

In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, co-administration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with ACE inhibitors, including ramipril, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving ramipril and NSAID therapy. 
The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors, including ramipril, may be attenuated by NSAIDs. 







7.7 mTOR Inhibitors or Other Drugs Known to Cause Angioedema

See Table 2 for clinically significant drug interactions with mefenamic acid.

  Table 2: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Mefenamic acid 





 Drugs That Interfere with Hemostasis





Clinical Impact:


 • Mefenamic acid and anticoagulants such as warfarin have a synergistic effect on bleeding. The concomitant use of mefenamic acid and anticoagulants have an increased risk of serious bleeding compared to the use of either drug alone. • Serotonin release by platelets plays an important role in hemostasis. Case-control and cohort epidemiological studies showed that concomitant use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and an NSAID may potentiate the risk of bleeding more than an NSAID alone.




Intervention:


 Monitor patients with concomitant use of mefenamic acid with anticoagulants (e.g.,warfarin), antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for signs of bleeding (see 
WARNINGS; Hematologic Toxicity) .




 Aspirin





Clinical Impact:


 Controlled clinical studies showed that the concomitant use of NSAIDs and analgesic doses of aspirin does not produce any greater therapeutic effect than the use of NSAIDs alone. In a clinical study, the concomitant use of an NSAID and aspirin was associated with a significantly increased incidence of GI adverse reactions as compared to use of the NSAID alone (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation) .




Intervention:


 Concomitant use of mefenamic acid and analgesic doses of aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding (see 
WARNINGS; Hematologic Toxicity).
 Mefenamic acid is not a substitute for low dose aspirin for cardiovascular protection.




 ACE Inhibitors, Angiotensin Receptor Blockers, and Beta-Blockers





Clinical Impact:


 • NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or beta-blockers (including propranolol). • In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or have renal impairment, co-administration of an NSAID with ACE inhibitors or ARBs may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible.




Intervention:


 •  During concomitant use of mefenamic acid and ACE-inhibitors, ARBs, or beta-blockers, monitor blood pressure to ensure that the desired blood pressure is obtained. • During concomitant use of mefenamic acid and ACE-inhibitors or ARBs in patients who are elderly, volume-depleted, or have impaired renal function, monitor for signs of worsening renal function (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia).
 • When these drugs are administered concomitantly, patients should be adequately hydrated. Assess renal function at the beginning of the concomitant treatment and periodically thereafter.




 Diuretics





Clinical Impact:


 Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, showed that NSAIDs reduced the natriuretic effect of loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to the NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.




Intervention


 During concomitant use of mefenamic acid with diuretics, observe patients for signs of worsening renal function, in addition to assuring diuretic efficacy including antihypertensive effects (see WARNINGS; Renal Toxicity and Hyperkalemia).





 Digoxin





Clinical Impact:


 The concomitant use of mefenamic acid with digoxin has been reported to increase the serum concentration and prolong the half-life of digoxin.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of mefenamic acid and digoxin, monitor serum digoxin levels.




 Lithium





Clinical Impact:


 NSAIDs have produced elevations in plasma lithium levels and reductions in renal lithium clearance.  The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15%, and the renal clearance decreased by approximately 20%. This effect has been attributed to NSAID inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of mefenamic acid and lithium, monitor patients for signs of lithium toxicity.




 Methotrexate





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of NSAIDs and methotrexate may increase the risk for methotrexate toxicity (e.g., neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction).




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of PONSTEL and methotrexate, monitor patients for methotrexate toxicity.




 Cyclosporine





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of PONSTEL and cyclosporine may increase cyclosporine's nephrotoxicity.




Intervention:


 During concomitant use of PONSTEL and cyclosporine, monitor patients for signs of worsening renal function.




 NSAIDs and Salicylates





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of mefenamic acid with other NSAIDs or salicylates (e.g., diflunisal, salsalate) increases the risk of GI toxicity, with little or no increase in efficacy (see WARNINGS; Gastrointestinal Bleeding, Ulceration and Perforation).





Intervention:


 The concomitant use of mefenamic acid with other NSAIDs or salicylates is not recommended.




 Pemetrexed





Clinical Impact:


 Concomitant use of mefenamic acid and pemetrexed may increase the risk of pemetrexed-associated myelosuppression, renal, and GI toxicity (see the pemetrexed prescribing information).





Intervention:


 During concomitant use of mefenamic acid and pemetrexed, in patients with renal impairment whose creatinine clearance ranges from 45 to 79 mL/min, monitor for myelosuppression, renal and GI toxicity. NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethacin) should be avoided for a period of two days before, the day of, and two days following administration of pemetrexed. In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between pemetrexed and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least five days before, the day of, and two days following pemetrexed administration.




 Antacid





Clinical Impact:


 In a single dose study (n=6), ingestion of an antacid containing 1.7-gram of magnesium hydroxide with 500-mg of mefenamic acid increased the Cmax and AUC of mefenamic acid by 125% and 36%, respectively.




Intervention:

Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, when administered concomitantly with nitrofurantoin, reduce both the rate and extent of absorption. The mechanism for this interaction probably is adsorption of nitrofurantoin onto the surface of magnesium trisilicate.
Uricosuric drugs, such as probenecid and sulfinpyrazone, can inhibit renal tubular secretion of nitrofurantoin. The resulting increase in nitrofurantoin serum levels may increase toxicity, and the decreased urinary levels could lessen its efficacy as a urinary tract antibacterial.","Antacids containing magnesium trisilicate, probenecid, sulfinpyrazone"

Careful observation is required when amantadine is administered concurrently with central nervous system stimulants. Agents with anticholinergic properties may potentiate the anticholinergic-like side effects of amantadine.
Coadministration of thioridazine has been reported to worsen the tremor in elderly patients with Parkinson’s disease, however, it is not known if other phenothiazines produce a similar response. Coadministration of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules resulted in a higher plasma amantadine concentration in a 61-year-old man receiving amantadine (hydrochloride capsules) 100 mg t.i.d. for Parkinson’s disease1. It is not known which of the components of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide capsules contributed to the observation or if related drugs produce a similar response.
Coadministration of quinine or quinidine with amantadine was shown to reduce the renal clearance of amantadine by about 30%.
The concurrent use of amantadine with live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) intranasal has not been evaluated. However, because of the potential for interference between these products, LAIV should not be administered within 2 weeks before or 48 hours after administration of amantadine, unless medically indicated. The concern about possible interference arises from the potential for antiviral drugs to inhibit replication of live vaccine virus. Trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine can be administered at any time relative to use of amantadine.","central nervous system stimulants, thioridazine, phenothiazines, triamterene, hydrochlorothiazide, quinine, quinidine, live attenuated influenza vaccine, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine"

Cimetidine and Antacids — Single doses of cimetidine (800 mg) or aluminum- and magnesium-containing antacids did not affect the oral bioavailability of olanzapine.
  
         
 
  



Inducers of CYP1A2 — Carbamazepine therapy (200 mg bid) causes an approximately 50% increase in the clearance of olanzapine. This increase is likely due to the fact that carbamazepine is a potent inducer of CYP1A2 activity. Higher daily doses of carbamazepine may cause an even greater increase in olanzapine clearance.
  
         
 
  



Alcohol — Ethanol (45 mg/70 kg single dose) did not have an effect on olanzapine pharmacokinetics. The co-administration of alcohol (i.e., ethanol) with olanzapine potentiated the orthostatic hypotension observed with olanzapine

  .
  
         
 
  



Inhibitors of CYP1A2




Fluvoxamine: Fluvoxamine, a CYP1A2 inhibitor, decreases the clearance of olanzapine. This results in a mean increase in olanzapine Cmax following fluvoxamine of 54% in female nonsmokers and 77% in male smokers. The mean increase in olanzapine AUC is 52% and 108%, respectively. Lower doses of olanzapine should be considered in patients receiving concomitant treatment with fluvoxamine.
  
         
 
  



Inhibitors of CYP2D6




Fluoxetine: Fluoxetine (60 mg single dose or 60 mg daily dose for 8 days) causes a small (mean 16%) increase in the maximum concentration of olanzapine and a small (mean 16%) decrease in olanzapine clearance. The magnitude of the impact of this factor is small in comparison to the overall variability between individuals, and therefore dose modification is not routinely recommended. When using olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination, also refer to the Drug Interactions section of the package insert for Symbyax.
  
         
 
  



Warfarin — Warfarin (20 mg single dose) did not affect olanzapine pharmacokinetics

Inducers of CYP1A2 or Glucuronyl Transferase — Omeprazole and rifampin may cause an increase in olanzapine clearance.
  
         
 
  



Charcoal — The administration of activated charcoal (1 g) reduced the Cmax and AUC of oral olanzapine by about 60%. As peak olanzapine levels are not typically obtained until about 6 hours after dosing, charcoal may be a useful treatment for olanzapine overdose.
 
        

 

Anticholinergic Drugs — Concomitant treatment with olanzapine and other drugs with anticholinergic activity can increase the risk for severe gastrointestinal adverse reactions related to hypomotility. Olanzapine should be used with caution in patients receiving medications having anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) effects 
  
         
 
  [see 

Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. 
  
         
 
  









7.2 Potential for Olanzapine to Affect Other Drugs



CNS Acting Drugs — Given the primary CNS effects of olanzapine, caution should be used when olanzapine is taken in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol.
         
 
  
         
 
  

Antihypertensive Agents — Olanzapine, because of its potential for inducing hypotension, may enhance the effects of certain antihypertensive agents.
         
 
  
         
 
  

Levodopa and Dopamine Agonists — Olanzapine may antagonize the effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists.
         
 
  
         
 
  

Lithium — Multiple doses of olanzapine (10 mg for 8 days) did not influence the kinetics of lithium. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of lithium 
         
 
  
         
 
  [see

  .
         
 
  
         
 
  

Valproate — Olanzapine (10 mg daily for 2 weeks) did not affect the steady state plasma concentrations of valproate. Therefore, concomitant olanzapine administration does not require dosage adjustment of valproate

  .
         
 
  
         
 
  

Effect of Olanzapine on Drug Metabolizing Enzymes — In vitro studies utilizing human liver microsomes suggest that olanzapine has little potential to inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A. Thus, olanzapine is unlikely to cause clinically important drug interactions mediated by these enzymes.
         
 
  
         
 
  

Imipramine — Single doses of olanzapine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of imipramine or its active metabolite desipramine.

Effect of Itraconazole on Other Drugs

Itraconazole and its major metabolite, hydroxy-itraconazole, are potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Itraconazole is an inhibitor of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Consequently, itraconazolehas the potential to interact with many concomitant drugs resulting in either increased or sometimes decreased concentrations of the concomitant drugs. Increased concentrations may increase the risk of adverse reactions associated with the concomitant drug which can be severe or life-threatening in some cases (e.g., QT prolongation, Torsade de Pointes, respiratory depression, hepatic adverse reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, myelosuppression, hypotension, seizures, angioedema, atrial fibrillation, bradycardia, priapism). Reduced concentrations of concomitant drugs may reduce their efficacy. Table 1 lists examples of drugs that may have their concentrations affected by itraconazole, but it is not a comprehensive list. 
Refer to the approved product labeling to become familiar with the interaction pathways, risk potential, and specific actions to be taken with regards to each concomitant drug prior to initiating therapy with itraconazole.
Although many of the clinical drug interactions in Table 1 are based on information with a similar azole antifungal, ketoconazole, these interactions are expected to occur with itraconazole.

MIRABEGRON extended-release tablets, for oral useInitial U.S. Approval: 2012",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug interaction studies were conducted in adult patients to investigate the effect of coadministered drugs on the pharmacokinetics of mirabegron and the effect of mirabegron on the pharmacokinetics of coadministered drugs (e.g., ketoconazole, rifampin, solifenacin succinate, tamsulosin, and oral contraceptives) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is recommended when these drugs are coadministered with mirabegron.
The following are drug interactions for which monitoring is recommended:







Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Mirabegron is a CYP2D6 inhibitor and, when used concomitantly with drugs metabolized by CYP2D6, especially narrow therapeutic index drugs, appropriate monitoring and possible dose adjustment of those drugs may be necessary. (5.4, 7.1, 12.3)

Digoxin: When initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, use the lowest dose of digoxin; monitor serum digoxin concentrations to titrate digoxin dose to desired clinical effect. (7.2, 12.3)


Pediatric use information is approved for Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s MYRBETRIQ (mirabegron extended-release tablets). However, due to Astellas Pharma Global Development, Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information.







7.1 Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6

Since mirabegron is a moderate CYP2D6 inhibitor, the systemic exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 enzyme, is increased when coadministered with mirabegron. Therefore, appropriate monitoring and dose adjustment may be necessary when mirabegron is coadministered with these drugs, especially with narrow therapeutic index CYP2D6 substrates [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].







7.2 Digoxin

When given in combination, 100 mg mirabegron increased mean digoxin Cmax from 1.01 to 1.3 ng/mL (29%) and AUC from 16.7 to 19.3 ng.h/mL (27%). For patients who are initiating a combination of mirabegron and digoxin, the lowest dose for digoxin should initially be considered. Serum digoxin concentrations should be monitored and used for titration of the digoxin dose to obtain the desired clinical effect [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].







7.3 Warfarin

The mean Cmax of S- and R-warfarin was increased by approximately 4% and AUC by approximately 9% when administered as a single dose of 25 mg after multiple doses of 100 mg mirabegron. Following a single dose administration of 25 mg warfarin, mirabegron had no effect on the warfarin pharmacodynamic endpoints such as International Normalized Ratio (INR) and prothrombin time. However, the effect of mirabegron on multiple doses of warfarin and on warfarin pharmacodynamic end points such as INR and prothrombin time has not been fully investigated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].","ketoconazole, rifampin, solifenacin succinate, tamsulosin, oral contraceptives, digoxin, warfarin"

7.1 Strong CYP2C8 Inhibitors


An inhibitor of CYP2C8 (e.g., gemfibrozil) significantly increases the exposure (area under the serum concentration-time curve or AUC) and half-life (t
 
  1/2) of pioglitazone. Therefore, the maximum recommended dose of pioglitazone is 15 mg daily if used in combination with gemfibrozil or other strong CYP2C8 inhibitors

7.2 CYP2C8 Inducers


An inducer of CYP2C8 (e.g., rifampin) may significantly decrease the exposure (AUC) of pioglitazone. Therefore, if an inducer of CYP2C8 is started or stopped during treatment with pioglitazone, changes in diabetes treatment may be needed based on clinical response without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of 45 mg for pioglitazone

  . Check serum potassium levels when ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy is altered in patients receiving spironolactone.

 
Examples of drugs that can increase potassium include:

ACE inhibitors
angiotensin receptor blockers
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
heparin and low molecular weight heparin

7.2 Lithium

Like other diuretics, spironolactone reduces the renal clearance of lithium, thus increasing the risk of lithium toxicity. Monitor lithium levels periodically when spironolactone is coadministered
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (
  
   12.3)]
 
  .

 







7.3 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

In some patients, the administration of an NSAID can reduce the diuretic, natriuretic, and antihypertensive effect of diuretics. Therefore, when spironolactone and NSAIDs are used concomitantly, monitor closely to determine if the desired effect of the diuretic is obtained
 
  [see Clinical Pharmacology (

7.4 Digoxin

Spironolactone and its metabolites interfere with radioimmunoassays for digoxin and increase the apparent exposure to digoxin. It is unknown to what extent, if any, spironolactone may increase actual digoxin exposure. In patients taking concomitant digoxin, use an assay that does not interact with spironolactone.







7.5 Cholestyramine

Hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis has been reported in patients given spironolactone concurrently with cholestyramine.







7.6 Acetylsalicylic Acid

Acetylsalicylic acid may reduce the efficacy of spironolactone. Therefore, when spironolactone and acetylsalicylic acid are used concomitantly, spironolactone may need to be titrated to higher maintenance dose and the patient should be observed closely to determine if the desired effect is obtained

7.2 Drugs Known to Have Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Allopurinol


Table 3: Interventions for Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Allopurinol





Capecitabine





Clinical Impact


Concomitant use with allopurinol may decrease concentration of capecitabine's active metabolites, which may decrease capecitabine efficacy. 
     




Intervention


Avoid the use of allopurinol during treatment with capecitabine 
     




Chlorpropamide





Clinical Impact


Allopurinol prolongs the half-life of chlorpropamide as both compete for renal tubular excretion. In patients with renal insufficiency, the risk of hypoglycemia may be increased due to this mechanism. 
     




Intervention


Monitor patients with renal insufficiency for hypoglycemia when administering chlorpropamide and allopurinol concomitantly. 
     




Cyclosporine





Clinical Impact


Concomitant use of allopurinol increases cyclosporine concentrations, which may increase the risk of adverse reactions. 
     




Intervention


Increase frequency of monitoring cyclosporine concentrations as reflected in its prescribing information and modify the dosage of cyclosporine as appropriate when used concomitantly with allopurinol. 
     




Cyclophosphamide and Other Cytotoxic Agents





Clinical Impact


Concomitant use of allopurinol with cyclophosphamide and other cytotoxic agents (doxorubicin, bleomycin, procarbazine, mechloroethamine) increases bone marrow suppression among patients with neoplastic disease, except leukemia. 
     




Intervention


Blood count monitoring and regular physician follow-up are recommended. 
     




Dicumarol





Clinical Impact


Allopurinol prolongs the half-life of the anticoagulant, dicumarol. The mechanism of this drug interaction has not been established but should be noted when allopurinol is given to patients already on dicumarol therapy. 
     




Intervention


Monitor prothrombin time. Adjust the dosage of dicumarol accordingly when allopurinol is added to anticoagulant therapy. 
     




Fluorouracil





Clinical Impact


Based on non-clinical data, allopurinol may decrease anti-tumor activity due to suppression of phosphorylation of 5-fluorouracil. 
     




Intervention


Concomitant administration with fluorouracil should be avoided. 
     




Mercaptopurine or Azathioprine





Clinical Impact


Allopurinol inhibits xanthine oxidase mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine and azathioprine. Concomitant use of allopurinol increases the exposure of either mercaptopurine or azathioprine which may increase the risk of their adverse reactions, including myelosuppression
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions
     
      5.5].
    
     





Intervention


In patients receiving mercaptopurine or azathioprine, the concomitant administration of 300 mg to 600 mg of allopurinol per day will require a reduction in dose to approximately one third to one fourth of the usual dose of mercaptopurine or azathioprine. Subsequent adjustment of doses of mercaptopurine or azathioprine should be made on the basis of therapeutic response and the appearance of toxic effects. 
     




Pegloticase                           





Clinical Impact


Concomitant use of allopurinol and pegloticase may potentially blunt the rise of serum uric acid levels and increase the risk of pegloticase related anaphylaxis in patients whose uric acid level increase to above 6 mg/dL. 
     




Intervention    


Discontinue and do not institute allopurinol therapy during treatment with pegloticase. 
     




Theophylline





Clinical Impact


Concomitant use of allopurinol doses greater than or equal to 600 mg/day may decrease the clearance of theophylline 
     




Intervention


Monitor  and  adjust  theophylline  doses  as  reflected  in  the  prescribing information. 
     




Uricosuric Drugs





Clinical Impact


Uricosuric agents increase the excretion of the active allopurinol metabolite oxypurinol. Concomitant use with uricosuric agents decreases oxypurinol exposure which may reduce the inhibition of xanthine oxidase by oxypurinol and increases the urinary excretion of uric acid. 
       The net effect of such combined therapy may be useful in some patients in achieving minimum serum uric acid levels provided the total urinary uric acid load does not exceed the competence of the patient's kidney function. 
     




Intervention


Monitor uric acid levels due to the increased chance of hypouricemic effects. 
     




Warfarin





Clinical Impact


Allopurinol may inhibit the metabolism of warfarin, possibly enhancing its anticoagulant effect. 
     




Intervention


Monitor patients on concomitant therapy for excessive anticoagulation. Assess INR frequently and adjust warfarin dosage accordingly when allopurinol is added to warfarin therapy.","bendamustine,thiazide diuretics,ampicillin,amoxicillin,capecitabine,mercaptopurine,azathioprine,pegloticase,chlorpropamide,cyclosporine,cyclophosphamide,doxorubicin,bleomycin,procarbazine,mechloroethamine,dicumarol,fluorouracil,theophylline,uricosuric drugs,warfarin"

Ropivacaine should be used with caution in patients receiving other local anesthetics or agents structurally related to amide-type local anesthetics, since the toxic effects of these drugs are additive. Cytochrome P4501A2 is involved in the formation of 3-hydroxy ropivacaine, the major metabolite. In vivo, the plasma clearance of ropivacaine was reduced by 70% during coadministration of fluvoxamine (25 mg bid for 2 days), a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor. Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2, such as fluvoxamine, given concomitantly during administration of ropivacaine, can interact with ropivacaine leading to increased ropivacaine plasma levels. Caution should be exercised when CYP1A2 inhibitors are coadministered. Possible interactions with drugs known to be metabolized by CYP1A2 via competitive inhibition such as theophylline and imipramine may also occur. Coadministration of a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (100 mg bid for 2 days with ropivacaine infusion administered 1 hour after ketoconazole) caused a 15% reduction in in vivo plasma clearance of ropivacaine. 
Specific trials studying the interaction between ropivacaine and class III antiarrhythmic drugs (e.g., amiodarone) have not been performed, but caution is advised [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

Table 2: Clinically Relevant Interactions Affecting Drugs Co-Administered with Rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and Interactions with Diagnostics









Antiretrovirals  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

The effect of PPI on antiretroviral drugs is variable. The clinical importance and the mechanisms behind these interactions are not always known. 
       • Decreased exposure of some antiretroviral drugs (e.g., rilpivirine, atazanavir, and nelfinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may reduce antiviral effect and promote the development of drug resistance. 
       • Increased exposure of other antiretroviral drugs (e.g., saquinavir) when used concomitantly with rabeprazole may increase toxicity
    
     .
  • There are other antiretroviral drugs which do not result in clinically relevant interactions with rabeprazole. 
     




Intervention:  
     


Rilpivirine-containing products: Concomitant use with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets is contraindicated
    
     [see Contraindications (
     
      4)]
    
     . See prescribing information.

Saquinavir: See the prescribing information for saquinavir and monitor for potential saquinavir toxicities. 
     
Other antiretrovirals: See prescribing information. 
     




Warfarin  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

Increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving PPIs, including rabeprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.2)]
    
     . 
     




Intervention:  
     

Monitor INR and prothrombin time. Dose adjustment of warfarin may be needed to maintain target INR range. See prescribing information for warfarin. 
     




Methotrexate  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

Concomitant use of rabeprazole with methotrexate (primarily at high dose) may elevate and prolong serum levels of methotrexate and/or its metabolite hydroxymethotrexate, possibly leading to methotrexate toxicities. No formal drug interaction studies of methotrexate with PPIs have been conducted
    
     [see Warnings and Precautions (
     
      5.9)].
    
     





Intervention:  
     

A temporary withdrawal of rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets may be considered in some patients receiving high dose methotrexate administration. 
     




Digoxin  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

Potential for increased exposure of digoxin
    
     [see Clinical Pharmacology (
     
      12.3)].
    
     





Intervention:  
     

Monitor digoxin concentrations. Dose adjustment of digoxin may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for digoxin. 
     




Drugs Dependent on Gastric pH for Absorption (e.g., iron salts, erlotinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, mycophenolate mofetil, ketoconazole, itraconazole)  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

Rabeprazole can reduce the absorption of other drugs due to its effect on reducing intragastric acidity. 
     




Intervention:  
     

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF): Co-administration of PPIs in healthy subjects and in transplant patients receiving MMF has been reported to reduce the exposure to the active metabolite, mycophenolic acid (MPA), possibly due to a decrease in MMF solubility at an increased gastric pH. The clinical relevance of reduced MPA exposure on organ rejection has not been established in transplant patients receiving rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets and MMF. Use rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets with caution in transplant patients receiving MMF. See the prescribing information for other drugs dependent on gastric pH for absorption. 
     




Combination Therapy with Clarithromycin and Amoxicillin  
     




Clinical Impact:  
     

Concomitant administration of clarithromycin with other drugs can lead to serious adverse reactions, including potentially fatal arrhythmias, and are contraindicated. 
       Amoxicillin also has drug interactions. 
     




Intervention:

Clinical Impact:


Potentially increased exposure of tacrolimus, especially in transplant patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C19. 
     




Intervention:


Monitor tacrolimus whole blood trough concentrations. Dose adjustment of tacrolimus may be needed to maintain therapeutic drug concentrations. See prescribing information for tacrolimus. 
     




Interactions with Investigations of Neuroendocrine Tumors





Clinical Impact:


Serum chromogranin A (CgA) levels increase secondary to PPI-induced decreases in gastric acidity. The increased CgA level may cause false positive results in diagnostic investigations for neuroendocrine tumors
    
     .





Intervention:


Temporarily stop rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets treatment at least 14 days before assessing CgA levels and consider repeating the test if initial CgA levels are high. If serial tests are performed (e.g. for monitoring), the same commercial laboratory should be used for testing, as reference ranges between tests may vary. 
     




Interaction with Secretin Stimulation Test





Clinical Impact:


Hyper-response in gastrin secretion in response to secretin stimulation test, falsely suggesting gastrinoma
    
     .





Intervention:


  Temporarily stop treatment with rabeprazole sodium delayed-release tablets at least 14 days before assessing to allow gastrin levels to return to baseline. 
     




False Positive Urine Tests for THC





Clinical Impact:


There have been reports of false positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving PPIs. 
     




Intervention:


An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.

CIV",DI,"Drug Interactions

Most reports of clinically significant drug interactions occurring with the barbiturates have involved phenobarbital. However, the application of these data to other barbiturates appears valid and warrants serial blood level determinations of the relevant drugs when there are multiple therapies.


Anticoagulants.Phenobarbital lowers the plasma levels of dicumarol and causes a decrease in anticoagulant activity as measured by the prothrombin time. Barbiturates can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes resulting in increased metabolism and decreased anticoagulant response of oral anticoagulants (e.g., acenocoumarol, warfarin, dicumarol, and phenprocoumon). Patients stabilized on anticoagulant therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
 
  

Corticosteroids.Barbiturates appear to enhance the metabolism of exogenous corticosteroids, probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes. Patients stabilized on corticosteroid therapy may require dosage adjustments if barbiturates are added to or withdrawn from their dosage regimen.
 
  

Griseofulvin.Phenobarbital appears to interfere with the absorption of orally administered griseofulvin, thus decreasing its blood level. The effect of the resultant decreased blood levels of griseofulvin on therapeutic response has not been established. However, it would be preferable to avoid concomitant administration of these drugs.
 
  

Doxycycline.Phenobarbital has been shown to shorten the half-life of doxycycline for as long as 2 weeks after barbiturate therapy is discontinued. This mechanism is probably through the induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes that metabolize the antibiotic. If phenobarbital and doxycycline are administered concurrently, the clinical response to doxycycline should be monitored closely.
 
  

Phenytoin, Sodium Valproate, Valproic Acid.The effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin appears to be variable. Some investigators report an accelerating effect, whereas others report no effect. Because the effect of barbiturates on the metabolism of phenytoin is not predictable, phenytoin and barbiturate blood levels should be monitored more frequently if these drugs are given concurrently. Sodium valproate and valproic acid increase the phenobarbital serum levels; therefore, phenobarbital blood levels should be closely monitored and appropriate dosage adjustments made as clinically indicated.

TABLE 6Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Escitalopram
 
  








Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs)






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of SSRIs, including escitalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.





Intervention:



Escitalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue
     
      [see Dosage and Administration (
      
       2.7), Contraindications (
      
       4), and Warnings and Precautions (
      
       5.2)]
     
      .
    
     





Pimozide






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of racemic citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of racemic citalopram alone
     
      [see Clinical Pharmacology (
      
       12.3)].
     
      






Intervention:



Escitalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide
     
      [see Contraindications (
      
       4)].
     
      






Other Serotonergic Drugs






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of escitalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome.





Intervention:



Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during escitalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of escitalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs
     
      [see Warning and Precautions (
      
       5.2)]
     
      .
    
     





Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (NSAIDs, Aspirin, Warfarin, etc.)






Clinical Impact:



Concomitant use of escitalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding.





Intervention:



Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of escitalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international
normalized ratio
     
      [see Warning and Precautions (
      
       5.7)]
     
      .
    
     





Sumatriptan






Clinical Impact:



There have been postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of an SSRI and sumatriptan.





Intervention:



If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised
     
      [see Warning and Precautions (
      
       5.2)]
     
      .
    
     





Carbamazepine






Clinical Impact:



Combined administration of racemic citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate.





Intervention:



Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of escitalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.





Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6






Clinical Impact:



Coadministration of escitalopram (20 mg/day for 21 days) with the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine
(single dose of 50 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, resulted in a 40% increase in C
     
      maxand a 100% increase in AUC of desipramine.
    
     





Intervention:



The clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Exercise caution during coadministration of escitalopram and drugs metabolized by CYP2D6.

Co-administration with allopurinol increases the risk of rash. (7.3)
Amoxicillin may reduce the efficacy of oral contraceptives. (7.4)








7.1 Probenecid


Probenecid decreases the renal tubular secretion of amoxicillin. Concurrent use of amoxicillin and probenecid may result in increased and prolonged blood levels of amoxicillin.








7.2 Oral Anticoagulants


Abnormal prolongation of prothrombin time (increased international normalized ratio [INR]) has been reported in patients receiving amoxicillin and oral anticoagulants. Appropriate monitoring should be undertaken when anticoagulants are prescribed concurrently. Adjustments in the dose of oral anticoagulants may be necessary to maintain the desired level of anticoagulation.








7.3 Allopurinol


The concurrent administration of allopurinol and amoxicillin increases the incidence of rashes in patients receiving both drugs as compared to patients receiving amoxicillin alone. It is not known whether this potentiation of rashes is due to allopurinol or the hyperuricemia present in these patients.








7.4 Oral Contraceptives


Amoxicillin may affect the intestinal flora, leading to lower estrogen reabsorption and reduced efficacy of combined oral estrogen/progesterone contraceptives.








7.5 Other Antibacterials


Chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, and tetracyclines may interfere with the bactericidal effects of penicillin. This has been demonstrated in vitro; however, the clinical significance of this interaction is not well documented.








7.6 Effects on Laboratory Tests


High urine concentrations of ampicillin may result in false-positive reactions when testing for the presence of glucose in urine using CLINITEST®, Benedict’s Solution, or Fehling’s Solution. Since this effect may also occur with amoxicillin, it is recommended that glucose tests based on enzymatic glucose oxidase reactions (such as CLINISTIX®) be used. 
Following administration of ampicillin or amoxicillin to pregnant women, a transient decrease in plasma concentration of total conjugated estriol, estriol-glucuronide, conjugated estrone, and estradiol has been noted.","Probenecid, oral anticoagulants, allopurinol, oral contraceptives, chloramphenicol, macrolides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines"

Rx only",DI,"Drug Interactions





Antacids (Aluminum- or Magnesium-Containing)

Concomitant administration of 300 mg cefdinir capsules with 30 mL Maalox® TC suspension reduces the rate (Cmax) and extent (AUC) of absorption by approximately 40%. Time to reach Cmax is also prolonged by 1 hour. There are no significant effects on cefdinir pharmacokinetics if the antacid is administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after cefdinir. If antacids are required during cefdinir for oral suspension therapy, cefdinir for oral suspension should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the antacid.








Probenecid

As with other β-lactam antibiotics, probenecid inhibits the renal excretion of cefdinir, resulting in an approximate doubling in AUC, a 54% increase in peak cefdinir plasma levels, and a 50% prolongation in the apparent elimination t½. 








Iron Supplements and Foods Fortified With Iron

Concomitant administration of cefdinir with a therapeutic iron supplement containing 60 mg of elemental iron (as FeSO4) or vitamins supplemented with 10 mg of elemental iron reduced extent of absorption by 80% and 31%, respectively. If iron supplements are required during cefdinir for oral suspension therapy, cefdinir for oral suspension should be taken at least 2 hours before or after the supplement.
The effect of foods highly fortified with elemental iron (primarily iron-fortified breakfast cereals) on cefdinir absorption has not been studied.
Concomitantly administered iron-fortified infant formula (2.2 mg elemental iron/6 oz) has no significant effect on cefdinir pharmacokinetics. Therefore, cefdinir for oral suspension can be administered with iron-fortified infant formula.
There have been reports of reddish stools in patients receiving cefdinir. In many cases, patients were also receiving iron-containing products. The reddish color is due to the formation of a nonabsorbable complex between cefdinir or its breakdown products and iron in the gastrointestinal tract.","Antacids, Maalox, Probenecid, Iron Supplements, Foods Fortified With Iron, iron-fortified infant formula, iron-containing products"

PREGABALIN capsules, for oral use, CVInitial U.S. Approval: 2004",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Since pregabalin capsules are predominantly excreted unchanged in the urine, undergoes negligible metabolism in humans (less than 2% of a dose recovered in urine as metabolites), and does not bind to plasma proteins, its pharmacokinetics are unlikely to be affected by other agents through metabolic interactions or protein binding displacement. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that pregabalin capsules are unlikely to be involved in significant pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Specifically, there are no pharmacokinetic interactions between pregabalin and the following antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, and topiramate. Important pharmacokinetic interactions would also not be expected to occur between pregabalin capsules and commonly used antiepileptic drugs [see Clinical Pharmacology (12)].

Pharmacodynamics

Multiple oral doses of pregabalin capsules were co-administered with oxycodone, lorazepam, or ethanol. Although no pharmacokinetic interactions were seen, additive effects on cognitive and gross motor functioning were seen when pregabalin capsules was co-administered with these drugs.

Dual Blockade of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS)


Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to monotherapy. Most patients receiving the combination of two RAS inhibitors do not obtain any additional benefit compared to monotherapy. In general, avoid combined use of RAS inhibitors. Closely monitor blood pressure, renal function, and electrolytes in patients on enalapril maleate tablets and other agents that affect the RAS.
Do not coadminister aliskiren with enalapril maleate in patients with diabetes. Avoid use of aliskiren with enalapril maleate in patients with renal impairment (GFR <60 mL/min).


Hypotension - Patients on Diuretic Therapy


Patients on diuretics and especially those in whom diuretic therapy was recently instituted, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of therapy with enalapril. The possibility of hypotensive effects with enalapril can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with enalapril. If it is necessary to continue the diuretic, provide close medical supervision after the initial dose for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for at least an additional hour (see

Agents Causing Renin Release


The antihypertensive effect of enalapril maleate is augmented by antihypertensive agents that cause renin release (e.g., diuretics).","neprilysin inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, aliskiren, diuretics"

In vitroand
 
  in vivostudies have shown that estrogens are metabolized partially by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Therefore, inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect estrogen drug metabolism. Inducers of CYP3A4 such as St. John’s Wort preparations (Hypericum perforatum), phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and rifampin may reduce plasma concentrations of estrogens, possibly resulting in a decrease in therapeutic effects and/or changes in the uterine bleeding profile. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may increase plasma concentrations of estrogens and may result in side effects.","St. John’s Wort, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, rifampin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, grapefruit juice"

Aminoglutethimide: Aminoglutethimide may diminish adrenal suppression by corticosteroids.


Amphotericin B injection and potassium-depleting agents: When corticosteroids are administered concomitantly with potassium-depleting agents (e.g., amphotericin B, diuretics), patients should be observed closely for development of hypokalemia. In addition, there have been cases reported in which concomitant use of amphotericin B and hydrocortisone was followed by cardiac enlargement and congestive heart failure.


Antibiotics: Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to cause a significant decrease in corticosteroid clearance (see Drug Interactions, CYP 3A4 Inducers, CYP 3A4 Inhibitors, and CYP 3A4 Substrates).


Anticholinesterases: Concomitant use of anticholinesterase agents and corticosteroids may produce severe weakness in patients with myasthenia gravis. If possible, anticholinesterase agents should be withdrawn at least 24 hours before initiating corticosteroid therapy.


Anticoagulants, oral: Co-administration of corticosteroids and warfarin usually results in inhibition of response to warfarin, although there have been some conflicting reports. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored frequently to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.


Antidiabetics: Because corticosteroids may increase blood glucose concentrations, dosage adjustments of antidiabetic agents may be required.


Antitubercular drugs: Serum concentrations of isoniazid may be decreased.


Cholestyramine: Cholestyramine may increase the clearance of corticosteroids.


Cyclosporine: Increased activity of both cyclosporine and corticosteroids may occur when the two are used concurrently. Convulsions have been reported with this concurrent use.


Dexamethasone suppression test (DST): False-negative results in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) in patients being treated with indomethacin have been reported. Thus, results of the DST should be interpreted with caution in these patients.


Digitalis glycosides: Patients on digitalis glycosides may be at increased risk of arrhythmias due to hypokalemia.

 


Ephedrine: Ephedrine may enhance the metabolic clearance of corticosteroids, resulting in decreased blood levels and lessened physiologic activity, thus requiring an increase   in corticosteroid dosage.

Estrogens, including oral contraceptives: Estrogens may decrease the hepatic metabolism of certain corticosteroids, thereby increasing their effect.


CYP 3A4 Inducers: Dexamethasone is metabolized by CYP 3A4. Drugs which induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP 3A4) enzyme activity (e.g., barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin) may enhance the metabolism of corticosteroids and require that the dosage of the corticosteroid be increased.


CYP 3A4 Inhibitors: Concomitant administration of dexamethasone with erythromycin, a moderate CYP 3A4 inhibitor, has the potential to result in increased plasma concentrations of dexamethasone.

Ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, has been reported to decrease the metabolism of certain corticosteroids by up to 60%, leading to increased risk of corticosteroid side effects. In addition, ketoconazole alone can inhibit adrenal corticosteroid synthesis and may cause adrenal insufficiency during corticosteroid withdrawal. Co-administration with other drugs which strongly inhibit CYP 3A4 (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products) may lead to increased plasma concentrations of corticosteroids and potentially increase the risk for systemic corticosteroid side effects. Consider the benefit of co-administration versus the potential risk of systemic corticosteroid effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side effects.


CYP 3A4 Substrates: Dexamethasone is a moderate inducer of CYP 3A4. Co-administration with other drugs that are metabolized by CYP 3A4 (e.g., indinavir, erythromycin) may increase their clearance, resulting in decreased plasma concentration.


Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents (NSAIDS): Concomitant use of aspirin (or other nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory agents) and corticosteroids increases the risk of gastrointestinal side effects. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. The clearance of salicylates may be increased with concurrent use of corticosteroids.


Phenytoin: In post-marketing experience, there have been reports of both increases and decreases in phenytoin levels with dexamethasone co-administration, leading to alterations in seizure control.


Skin Tests: Corticosteroids may suppress reactions to skin tests.


Thalidomide: Co-administration with thalidomide should be employed cautiously, as toxic epidermal necrolysis has been reported with concomitant use.


Vaccines: Patients on corticosteroid therapy may exhibit a diminished response to toxoids and live or inactivated vaccines due to inhibition of antibody response. Corticosteroids may also potentiate the replication of some organisms contained in live attenuated vaccines. Routine administration of vaccines or toxoids should be deferred until corticosteroid therapy is discontinued if possible (see WARNINGS, Infections, Vaccination).","Aminoglutethimide, Amphotericin B, diuretics, hydrocortisone, Macrolide antibiotics, anticholinesterase agents, warfarin, antidiabetic agents, isoniazid, cholestyramine, cyclosporine, indomethacin, digitalis glycosides, ephedrine, estrogens, barbiturates, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, cobicistat-containing products, indinavir, aspirin, salicylates, thalidomide"
