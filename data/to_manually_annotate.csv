Thioridazine hydrochloride tablet use should be avoided in combination with other drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval and in patients with congenital long QT syndrome or a history of cardiac arrhythmias.
Reduced cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity drugs that inhibit this isozyme (e.g., fluoxetine and paroxetine) and certain other drugs (e.g., fluvoxamine, propranolol, and pindolol) appear to appreciably inhibit the metabolism of thioridazine. The resulting elevated levels of thioridazine would be expected to augment the prolongation of the QTc interval associated with thioridazine and may increase the risk of serious, potentially fatal, cardiac arrhythmias, such as Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias. Such an increased risk may result also from the additive effect of coadministering thioridazine with other agents that prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, thioridazine is contraindicated with these drugs as well as in patients, comprising about 7% of the normal population, who are known to have a genetic defect leading to reduced levels of activity of P450 2D6 (see 
       
 
  WARNINGS and

In common with other phenothiazines, thioridazine is contraindicated in severe central nervous system depression or comatose states from any cause including drug induced central nervous system depression (see

Androgens are contraindicated in men with carcinomas of the breast or with known or suspected carcinomas of the prostate, and in women who are or may become pregnant. When administered to pregnant women, androgens cause virilization of the external genitalia of the female fetus. This virilization includes clitoromegaly, abnormal vaginal development, and fusion of genital folds to form a scrotal-like structure. The degree of masculinization is related to the amount of drug given and the age of the fetus, and is most likely to occur in the female fetus when the drugs are given in the first trimester. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking these drugs, she should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus."

•The half-life of calcifediol is reduced by drugs stimulating microsomal hydroxylation, such as phenobarbital or other anticonvulsants. (7.4)








7.1 CYP3A Inhibitors 

Cytochrome P450 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin or voriconazole, may inhibit enzymes involved in vitamin D metabolism (CYP24A1 and CYP27B1), and may alter serum levels of calcifediol.  Dose adjustment of RAYALDEE may be required, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, intact PTH and serum calcium concentrations should be closely monitored if a patient initiates or discontinues therapy with a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor.








7.2 Thiazides 

Thiazides are known to induce hypercalcemia by reducing excretion of calcium in the urine.
Concomitant administration of thiazides with RAYALDEE may cause hypercalcemia.  Patients may require more frequent serum calcium monitoring in this setting [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

 Initial U.S. Approval: 1995",DI,"7 DRUG INTERACTIONS


Drug interaction studies have been completed with INVIRASE and saquinavir mesylate capsules (hard gel and soft gel). Observations from drug interaction studies with saquinavir mesylate capsules (soft gel) may not be predictive for INVIRASE/ritonavir. Because ritonavir is coadministered with INVIRASE, prescribers should also refer to the prescribing information for ritonavir regarding drug interactions associated with this agent.






INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, significantly increasing the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. (7.1)
Coadministration of INVIRASE/ritonavir with drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced efficacy. (7.2)
Certain drugs or drug classes should not be coadministered with INVIRASE/ritonavir based on drug interaction studies or predicted drug interactions. (5.2, 7.2, 7.3)








7.1      Potential for INVIRASE/Ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

The combination INVIRASE/ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A and may significantly increase the exposure of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP3A. Drugs that are contraindicated specifically due to the observed or expected magnitude of interaction and potential for serious or life-threatening adverse events are listed in Section 4 Contraindications [see Contraindications (4)]. Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring (see 
Table 2
).








7.2      Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVIRASE/Ritonavir

The metabolism of saquinavir is mediated primarily by CYP3A. Additionally, saquinavir is a substrate for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Therefore, drugs that affect CYP3A and/or P-gp may modify the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Coadministration with drugs that are potent inducers of CYP3A (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) may result in decreased plasma concentrations of saquinavir and reduced therapeutic effect.








7.3      Established and Other Potentially Significant Drug Interactions

Based on the finding of dose-dependent prolongations of QT and PR intervals in healthy volunteers receiving INVIRASE/ritonavir, additive effects on QT and/or PR interval prolongation may occur with certain members of the following drug classes: antiarrhythmics class IA or class III, neuroleptics, antidepressants, PDE5 inhibitors (when used for pulmonary arterial hypertension), antimicrobials, antihistaminics and others. This effect might lead to an increased risk of ventricular arrhythmias, notably torsade de pointes. Therefore, concurrent administration of these agents with INVIRASE/ritonavir is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

7.2 Agents that May Decrease FARYDAK Plasma Concentrations


CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration of FARYDAK with strong CYP3A inducers was not evaluated in vitro or in a clinical trial however, a reduction in panobinostat exposure is likely. An approximately 70% decrease in the systemic exposure of panobinostat in the presence of strong inducers of CYP3A was observed in simulations using mechanistic models. Therefore, the concomitant use of strong CYP3A inducers should be avoided [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].








7.3 Agents whose Plasma Concentrations May be Increased by FARYDAK


CYP2D6 Substrates: FARYDAK increased the median Cmax and AUC of a sensitive substrate of CYP2D6 by approximately 80% and 60%, respectively; however this was highly variable [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Avoid coadministrating FARYDAK with sensitive CYP2D6 substrates (i.e., atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, and venlafaxine) or CYP2D6 substrates that have a narrow therapeutic index (i.e., thioridazine, pimozide). If concomitant use of CYP2D6 substrates is unavoidable, monitor patients frequently for adverse reactions.








7.4 Drugs that Prolong QT interval

Concomitant use of anti-arrhythmic medicines (including, but not limited to amiodarone, disopyramide, procainamide, quinidine and sotalol) and other drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval (including, but not limited to chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, methadone, moxifloxacin, bepridil and pimozide) is not recommended. Anti-emetic drugs with known QT prolonging risk, such as dolasetron, ondansetron, and tropisetron can be used with frequent ECG monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

A single intravenous dose and oral dose of probenecid (500 mg each) followed by two oral doses of probenecid 500 mg at approximately hourly intervals administered to three healthy male subjects receiving a continuous infusion of cefotaxime increased the steady-state plasma concentration of cefotaxime by approximately 80%. In another study, administration of oral probenecid 500 mg every 6 hours to six healthy male subjects with cefotaxime 1 gram infused over 5 minutes decreased the total clearance of cefotaxime by approximately 50%.
Additionally, no disulfiram-like reactions were reported in a study conducted in 22 healthy volunteers administered cefotaxime and ethanol.Drug Interactions


As with other cephalosporins, cefotaxime may potentiate the nephrotoxic effects of nephrotoxic drugs such as aminoglycosides, NSAIDs and furosemide. 
Probenecid interferes with the renal tubular transfer of cefotaxime, decreasing the total clearance of cefotaxime by approximately 50% and increasing the plasma concentrations of cefotaxime. Administration of cefotaxime in excess of 6 grams/day should be avoided in patients receiving probenecid (see

TYBOST, in combination with atazanavir or darunavir, can alter the concentration of drugs metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6. Drugs that induce CYP3A can alter the concentrations of TYBOST, atazanavir and darunavir. Consult the full prescribing information prior to and during treatment for potential drug interactions. (4, 5.3, 7, 12.3)







7.1	Potential Effect of Cobicistat (Coadministered with Atazanavir or Darunavir) on the Pharmacokinetics of Concomitant Drugs

Cobicistat is an inhibitor of CYP3A and CYP2D6. The transporters that cobicistat inhibits include p-glycoprotein (P-gp), BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. The plasma concentration of drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP3A or CYP2D6, or are substrates of P-gp, BCRP, OATP1B1, or OATP1B3 may be increased if those drugs are coadministered with TYBOST.
Based on in vitro data, cobicistat is not expected to induce CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 and based on in vivo data, cobicistat is not expected to induce MDR1 or, in general, CYP3A to a clinically significant extent. The induction effect of cobicistat on CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or UGT1A1 is unknown, but is expected to be low based on CYP3A in vitro induction data.
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated. Coadministration with drugs that have active metabolite(s) formed by CYP3A may result in reduced plasma concentrations of these active metabolite(s). Coadministration with other CYP3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring as shown in Table 6.








7.2	Potential Effect of Concomitant Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Cobicistat (Coadministered with Atazanavir or Darunavir)

Cobicistat is metabolized by CYP3A, and to a minor extent, by CYP2D6. Atazanavir and darunavir are also metabolized by CYP3A.
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir in combination with drugs that induce CYP3A activity have the potential to decrease plasma concentrations of cobicistat, atazanavir, and darunavir, which may lead to loss of therapeutic effect and development of resistance (see Table 6).
Coadministration of TYBOST with atazanavir or darunavir in combination with other drugs that inhibit CYP3A may further increase the plasma concentrations of cobicistat, atazanavir, and darunavir (see Table 6).








7.3	Established and Other Potentially Significant Interactions

Coadministration of TYBOST with fosamprenavir, saquinavir, or tipranavir is not recommended because pharmacokinetic data are not available to provide appropriate dosing recommendations. Use of TYBOST with lopinavir is not recommended because lopinavir is co-formulated with ritonavir.
Table 6 provides dosing recommendations as a result of drug interactions with TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir or darunavir. These recommendations are based on either drug interaction trials or predicted interactions due to the expected magnitude of the interaction and potential for serious adverse events or loss of therapeutic effect [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

In Table 6, if not specifically stated, the drug interaction information applies to both coadministered agents: TYBOST coadministered with atazanavir or darunavir [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].
In addition to the drug interactions noted in Table 6, TYBOST is not recommended for use in combination with fixed-dose combination tablets that contain cobicistat, lopinavir/ritonavir or regimens containing ritonavir, or in combination with more than one antiretroviral agent that requires pharmacokinetic enhancement [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

Evaluate whether dosing adjustments of concomitant medications or coadministered antiretroviral drugs are necessary in:

Patients on a stable concomitant medication who initiate or switch to a TYBOST-containing regimen
Patients on a TYBOST-containing regimen who initiate a new concomitant medication
Patients initiating a TYBOST-containing regimen and a new concomitant medication simultaneously

Under these circumstances, also monitor for adverse events and/or monitor concentrations of concomitant medications if appropriate.
No dose adjustment is required when TDF or rilpivirine are coadministered with TYBOST and atazanavir or darunavir.

Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that meclofenamate sodium can reduce the natriuretic effect-of furosemide and thiazides in some patients. This response has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. During concomitant therapy with NSAIDs, the patient should be observed closely for signs of renal failure (see PRECAUTIONS: Renal Effects), as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. 










Lithium






NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. The mean minimum lithium concentration increased 15% and the renal clearance was decreased by approximately 20%. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by the NSAID. Thus, when NSAIDs and lithium are administered concurrently, subjects should be observed carefully for signs of lithium toxicity. 










Methotrexate






NSAIDs have been reported to competitively inhibit methotrexate accumulation in rabbit kidney slices. This may indicate that they could enhance the toxicity of methotrexate. Caution should be used when NSAIDs are administered concomitantly with methotrexate. 










Warfarin






The effects of warfarin and NSAIDs on GI bleeding are synergistic, such that users of both drugs together have a risk of serious GI bleeding higher than users of either drug alone."

Alcohol





Clinical Implications 


The coadministration of ADDYI with alcohol increased the risk of hypotension, syncope, and CNS depression compared to the use of ADDYI alone or alcohol alone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].





Preventing or Managing DI 


Counsel patients to wait at least two hours after consuming one or two standard alcoholic drinks before taking ADDYI at bedtime or to skip their ADDYI dose if they have consumed three or more alcoholic drinks that evening. [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Adverse Reactions (6.1)].





Other CNS Depressants 





Examples 


Diphenhydramine, opioids, hypnotics, benzodiazepines 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CNS depressants may increase the risk of CNS depression (e.g., somnolence) compared to the use of ADDYI alone. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the concomitant use of other CNS depressants with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors





Examples of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 


Ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, ritonavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, indinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir, telithromycin and conivaptan 




Examples of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 


Amprenavir, atazanavir, ciprofloxacin, diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, fosamprenavir, verapamil, and grapefruit juice 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors increases flibanserin exposure compared to the use of ADDYI alone. The risk of hypotension and syncope is increased with concomitant use of ADDYI and moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Adverse Reactions (6.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].





Preventing or Managing DI 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. 






Weak CYP3A4 Inhibitors





Examples 


Oral contraceptives, cimetidine, fluoxetine, ginkgo, ranitidine 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase the risk of adverse reactions. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the use of multiple weak CYP3A4 inhibitors with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





Strong CYP2C19 Inhibitors





Examples 


Proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, antifungals 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with strong CYP2C19 inhibitors may increase flibanserin exposure which may increase the risk of hypotension, syncope, and CNS depression. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Discuss the use of a strong CYP2C19 inhibitor with the patient when prescribing ADDYI. 





CYP3A4 Inducers





Examples 


Carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapetine, St. John's Wort 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CYP3A4 inducers substantially decreases flibanserin exposure compared to the use of ADDYI alone. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with CYP3A4 inducers is not recommended. 





Digoxin or Other P-glycoprotein Substrates





Examples 


Digoxin, sirolimus 




Clinical Implications 


The concomitant use of ADDYI with digoxin, a drug that is transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), increases the digoxin concentration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may lead to digoxin toxicity. 




Preventing or Managing DI 


Increase monitoring of concentrations of drugs transported by P-gp that have a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., digoxin).

Reduced cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity, drugs which inhibit this isozyme (e.g., fluoxetine and paroxetine), and certain other drugs (e.g., fluvoxamine, propranolol, and pindolol) appear to appreciably inhibit the metabolism of thioridazine. The resulting elevated levels of thioridazine would be expected to augment the prolongation of the QTc interval associated with thioridazine and may increase the risk of serious, potentially fatal, cardiac arrhythmias, such as Torsades de pointes type arrhythmias. Such an increased risk may result also from the additive effect of coadministering thioridazine with other agents that prolong the QTc interval. Therefore, thioridazine is contraindicated with these drugs as well as in patients, comprising about 7% of the normal population, who are known to have a genetic defect leading to reduced levels of activity of P450 2D6 (see 
         
 
  WARNINGS and 
         
 
  CONTRAINDICATIONS).
        

 








Drugs That Inhibit Cytochrome P450 2D6



In a study of 19 healthy male subjects, which included 6 slow and 13 rapid hydroxylators of debrisoquin, a single 25 mg oral dose of thioridazine produced a 2.4-fold higher C
           
 
  max and a 4.5-fold higher AUC for thioridazine in the slow hydroxylators compared to rapid hydroxylators. The rate of debrisoquin hydroxylation is felt to depend on the level of cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme activity. Thus, this study suggests that drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 or the presence of reduced activity levels of this isozyme will produce elevated plasma levels of thioridazine. Therefore, the coadministration of drugs that inhibit P450 2D6 with thioridazine and the use of thioridazine in patients known to have reduced activity of P450 2D6 are contraindicated.
          

 










Drugs That Reduce the Clearance of Thioridazine Through Other Mechanisms








Fluvoxamine 


The effect of fluvoxamine (25 mg b.i.d. for one week) on thioridazine steady-state concentration was evaluated in ten male inpatients with schizophrenia. Concentrations of thioridazine and its two active metabolites, mesoridazine and sulforidazine, increased 3-fold following coadministration of fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine and thioridazine should not be coadministered.









Propranolol 


Concurrent administration of propranolol (100 mg to 800 mg daily) has been reported to produce increases in plasma levels of thioridazine (approximately 50% to 400%) and its metabolites (approximately 80% to 300%). Propranolol and thioridazine should not be coadministered.









Pindolol 


Concurrent administration of pindolol and thioridazine have resulted in moderate, dose related increases in the serum levels of thioridazine and two of its metabolites, as well as higher than expected serum pindolol levels. Pindolol and thioridazine should not be coadministered.












Drugs That Prolong the QTc Interval



There are no studies of the coadministration of thioridazine and other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. However, it is expected that such coadministration would produce additive prolongation of the QTc interval and, thus, such use is contraindicated."

7.1 Effect of Other Drugs on VONJO








Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors

VONJO is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4. In a clinical drug interaction study, a single-dose of VONJO 400 mg was administered following treatment with clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Clarithromycin was administered as 500 mg twice daily for 5 days, which is a submaximal regimen for CYP3A4 inhibition. Compared to VONJO administered alone, the area under the concentration curve (AUC) and maximal concentration (Cmax) of pacritinib increased by 80% and 30%, respectively, upon coadministration with clarithromycin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The increase in exposure to pacritinib may be even higher when tested following a longer treatment with clarithromycin that results in maximal CYP3A4 inhibition. The impact of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of VONJO has not been investigated in clinical studies. Co-administration of VONJO with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Avoid concomitant use of VONJO with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











Strong and Moderate CYP3A4 inducers

In a clinical drug interaction study, a single-dose of VONJO 400 mg was administered following treatment with rifampin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, at 600 mg once daily for 10 days. Compared to VONJO administered alone, the AUC and Cmax of pacritinib decreased by 87% and 51%, respectively, upon coadministration with rifampin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The impact of moderate CYP3A4 inducers on the pharmacokinetics of VONJO has not been investigated in clinical studies. Co-administration of VONJO with strong CYP3A4 inducers is contraindicated. Avoid concomitant use of VONJO with moderate CYP3A4 inducers [see Contraindications (4), Warnings and Precautions (5.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











7.2 Effect of VONJO on Other Drugs








CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates

VONJO is an inhibitor of CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in vitro. Concomitant administration of VONJO with CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of these substrates. Avoid co-administration of VONJO with drugs that are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].











P-gp, BCRP, or OCT1 Substrates

VONJO is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1) in vitro. Concomitant administration of VONJO with P-gp, BCRP, or OCT1 substrates may increase the plasma concentrations of these substrates. Avoid co-administration of VONJO with drugs that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, BCRP, or OCT1 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."

Several studies investigated the possible interaction between miglitol and glyburide. In six healthy volunteers given a single dose of 5 mg glyburide on a background of 6 days treatment with miglitol (50 mg 3 times daily for 4 days followed by 100 mg 3 times daily for 2 days) or placebo, the mean C    max and AUC values for glyburide were 17% and 25% lower, respectively, when glyburide was given with miglitol. In a study in diabetic patients in which the effects of adding miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days or placebo to a background regimen of 3.5 mg glyburide daily were investigated, the mean AUC value for glyburide was 18% lower in the group treated with miglitol, although this difference was not statistically significant. Information on a potential interaction with glyburide was obtained from one of the large U.S. clinical trials (Study 7) in which patients were dosed with either miglitol or placebo on a background of glyburide 10 mg twice daily. At the 6-month and 1-year clinic visits, patients taking concomitant miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily exhibited mean C    max values for glyburide that were 16% and 8% lower, respectively, compared to patients taking glyburide alone. However, these differences were not statistically significant. Thus, although there was a trend toward lower AUC and C    max values for glyburide when co-administered with miglitol tablets, no definitive statement regarding a potential interaction can be made based on the foregoing three studies.  
The effect of miglitol (100 mg 3 times daily for 7 days) on the pharmacokinetics of a single 1000 mg dose of metformin was investigated in healthy volunteers. Mean AUC and C    max values for metformin were 12% to 13% lower when the volunteers were given miglitol as compared with placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant.  
In a study with healthy volunteers, co-administration of either 50 mg or 100 mg miglitol 3 times daily together with digoxin reduced the average plasma concentrations of digoxin by 19% and 28%, respectively. However, in diabetic patients under treatment with digoxin, plasma digoxin concentrations were not altered by co-administration of miglitol 100 mg 3 times daily for 14 days.
Other healthy volunteer studies have demonstrated that miglitol may significantly reduce the bioavailability of ranitidine and propranolol by 60% and 40%, respectively. No effect of miglitol was observed on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of either warfarin or nifedipine.
Intestinal adsorbents (e.g., charcoal) and digestive enzyme preparations containing carbohydrate-splitting enzymes (e.g., amylase, pancreatin) may reduce the effect of miglitol tablets and should not be taken concomitantly.
In 12 healthy males, concomitantly administered antacid did not influence the pharmacokinetics of miglitol."

Potential interactions between Cesamet 2 mg, and diazepam 5 mg; sodium secobarbital 100 mg; alcohol 45 mL (absolute laboratory alcohol); or codeine 65 mg, were evaluated in 15 subjects. Only a single combination was utilized at any one time. The subjects were evaluated according to physiologic (i.e., heart rate and blood pressure), psychometric, psychomotor, and subjective parameters. In this study, as expected, the depressant effects of the combinations were additive. Psychomotor function was particularly impaired with concurrent use of diazepam. Caution must thus be used when administering nabilone in combination with any CNS depressant.
Nabilone is purportedly highly bound to plasma proteins, and therefore, might displace other protein-bound drugs. Therefore, practitioners should monitor patients for a change in dosage requirements when administering nabilone to patients receiving other highly protein-bound drugs.

Animal Pharmacology and/or Toxicology

Monkeys treated with Cesamet at doses as high as 2 mg/kg/day for a year experienced no significant adverse events. This result contrasts with the findings in a planned 1-year dog study that was prematurely terminated because of deaths associated with convulsions in dogs receiving as little as 0.5 mg/kg/day. The earliest deaths, however, occurred at 56 days in dogs receiving 2 mg/kg/day. The unusual vulnerability of the dog to Cesamet is not understood; it is hypothesized, however, that the explanation lies in the fact that the dog differs markedly from other species in its metabolism of Cesamet."

Co-administration of APTIVUS can alter the concentrations of other drugs and other drugs may alter the concentration of tipranavir.  The potential for drug-drug interactions must be considered prior to and during therapy. (4, 5.3, 7)







7.1  Potential for APTIVUS/ritonavir to Affect Other Drugs

APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir at the recommended dose is a net inhibitor of CYP 3A and may increase plasma concentrations of agents that are primarily metabolized by CYP 3A. Thus, co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir with drugs highly dependent on CYP 3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)
]. Co-administration with other CYP 3A substrates may require a dose adjustment or additional monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7)
].
Clinically significant drug-drug interactions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir are summarized in Table 4 below. 
A phenotypic cocktail study was conducted with 16 healthy volunteers to quantify the influence of 10 days of APTIVUS/ritonavir capsule administration on the activity of hepatic CYP 1A2 (caffeine), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (omeprazole), 2D6 (dextromethorphan) and the activity of intestinal and hepatic CYP 3A4/5 (midazolam) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) (digoxin).  This study determined the first-dose and steady-state effects of 500 mg of APTIVUS co-administered with 200 mg of ritonavir twice daily in capsule form. APTIVUS oral solution co-administered with ritonavir capsules demonstrated similar effects as APTIVUS capsules co-administrated with ritonavir.
There was no net effect on CYP 2C9 or hepatic P-gp at first dose or steady state.  There was no net effect after first dose on CYP 1A2, but there was moderate induction at steady state.  There was modest inhibition of CYP 2C19 at the first dose, but there was marked induction at steady state.  Potent inhibition of CYP 2D6 and both hepatic and intestinal CYP 3A4/5 activities were observed after first dose and steady state. 
Intestinal and hepatic P-gp activity was assessed by administering oral and intravenous digoxin, respectively.  The digoxin results indicate P-gp was inhibited after the first dose of APTIVUS/ritonavir followed by induction of P-gp over time. Thus, it is difficult to predict the net effect of APTIVUS administered with ritonavir on oral bioavailability and plasma concentrations of drugs that are dual substrates of CYP 3A and P-gp. The net effect will vary depending on the relative affinity of the co-administered drugs for CYP 3A and P-gp, and the extent of intestinal first-pass metabolism/efflux.  An in vitro induction study in human hepatocytes showed an increase in UGT1A1 by tipranavir similar to that evoked by rifampin.  The clinical consequences of this finding have not been established.








7.2  Potential for Other Drugs to Affect Tipranavir 

Tipranavir is a CYP 3A substrate and a P-gp substrate. Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that induce CYP 3A and/or P-gp may decrease tipranavir plasma concentrations. Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir and drugs that inhibit P-gp may increase tipranavir plasma concentrations.  Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir with drugs that inhibit CYP 3A may not further increase tipranavir plasma concentrations, because the level of metabolites is low following steady-state administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir 500/200 mg twice daily. 
Clinically significant drug-drug interactions of APTIVUS co-administered with ritonavir are summarized in Table 4 below.

Single dose study.  Dosage reductions of rifabutin by 75% are recommended (e.g., 150 mg every other day).  Increased monitoring for adverse events in patients receiving the combination is warranted. Further dosage reduction may be necessary. 


Other Agents Commonly Used





Anticonvulsants:





CarbamazepinePhenobarbitalPhenytoin
↓ Tipranavir
Caution should be used when prescribing carbamazepine, phenobarbital and/or phenytoin.  APTIVUS may be less effective due to decreased tipranavir plasma concentration in patients taking these agents concomitantly.


Valproic Acid
↓ Valproic Acid
Caution should be used when prescribing valproic acid.  Valproic acid may be less effective due to decreased valproic acid plasma concentration in patients taking APTIVUS concomitantly.



Antidepressants:





Trazodone
↑ Trazodone
Concomitant use of trazodone and APTIVUS/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of trazodone.  Adverse events of nausea, dizziness, hypotension, and syncope have been observed following co-administration of trazodone and ritonavir.  If trazodone is used with a CYP 3A4 inhibitor such as APTIVUS/ritonavir, the combination should be used with caution and a lower dose of trazodone should be considered.


Desipramine
Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied↑ Desipramine
Dosage reduction and concentration monitoring of desipramine is recommended.


Selective Serotonin-Reuptake Inhibitors:
Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied
Antidepressants have a wide therapeutic index, but doses may need to be adjusted upon initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir therapy.


FluoxetineParoxetineSertraline
↑ Fluoxetine↑ Paroxetine↑ Sertraline




Anti-gout





Colchicine
↑ Colchicine
In patients with renal or hepatic impairment, coadministration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir is contraindicated.




In combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir, the following dosage adjustments are recommended in patients with normal renal and hepatic function:





Treatment of gout flares:  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:

0.6 mg (1 tablet) × 1 dose, followed by 0.3 mg (half tablet) 1 hour later. Dose to be repeated no earlier than 3 days.







Prophylaxis of gout flares:  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir: 									
If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg twice a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once a day.
If the original colchicine regimen was 0.6 mg once a day, the regimen should be adjusted to 0.3 mg once every other day.







Treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF):  Co-administration of colchicine in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:

Maximum daily dose of 0.6 mg (may be given as 0.3 mg twice a day).





Antipsychotics:





Quetiapine
↑ Quetiapine

Initiation of APTIVUS with ritonavir in patients taking quetiapine:





Consider alternative antiretroviral therapy to avoid increases in quetiapine exposures. If coadministration is necessary, reduce the quetiapine dose to 1/6 of the current dose and monitor for quetiapine-associated adverse reactions. Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for recommendations on adverse reaction monitoring.





Initiation of quetiapine in patients taking APTIVUS with ritonavir: 





Refer to the quetiapine prescribing information for initial dosing and titration of quetiapine. 



Benzodiazepines:





Parenterally administered midazolam 
↑ Midazolam
Midazolam is extensively metabolized by CYP 3A4. Increases in the concentration of midazolam are expected to be significantly higher with oral than parenteral administration.  Therefore, APTIVUS should not be given with orally administered midazolam [see Contraindications (4)
]. If APTIVUS is co-administered with parenteral midazolam, close clinical monitoring for respiratory depression and/or prolonged sedation should be exercised and dosage adjustments should be considered.


Buprenorphine/naloxone
↔ Buprenorphine↓ Tipranavir
APTIVUS/ritonavir did not result in changes in the clinical efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone.  Compared to historical controls tipranavir Cmin  was decreased approximately 40% with this combination.  Dose adjustments cannot be recommended.



Calcium Channel Blockers:

Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied. Cannot predict effect of TPV/ritonavir on calcium channel blockers that are dual substrates of CYP3A and P-gp due to conflicting effect of TPV/ritonavir on CYP3A and P-gp.
Caution is warranted and clinical monitoring of patients is recommended.

Disulfiram/Metronidazole
Combination with TPV/ritonavir not studied
APTIVUS capsules contain alcohol that can produce disulfiram-like reactions when co-administered with disulfiram or other drugs which produce this reaction (e.g., metronidazole).



Endothelin receptor antagonists



Co-administration of bosentan in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:



Bosentan
↑ Bosentan
In patients who have been receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir for at least 10 days, start bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability.





Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir in patients on bosentan: 





Discontinue use of bosentan at least 36 hours prior to initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir.




After at least 10 days following the initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir, resume bosentan at 62.5 mg once daily or every other day based upon individual tolerability. 



HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors:





AtorvastatinRosuvastatin
↑ Atorvastatin↓ Hydroxy-atorvastatin metabolites↑ Rosuvastatin
Avoid co-administration with atorvastatin.

The effect of TPV/ritonavir on CYP 2C8 substrate is not known.




Immunosuppressants:






Combination with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied.  Cannot predict effect of TPV/ritonavir on immunosuppressants due to conflicting effect of TPV/ritonavir on CYP 3A and P-gp.
Increased frequency of monitoring of plasma levels of immunosuppressant drugs is recommended.


CyclosporineSirolimusTacrolimus
↕ Cyclosporine ↕ Sirolimus↕ Tacrolimus




Inhaled beta agonist:





Salmeterol
↑ Salmeterol
Concurrent administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir is not recommended. The combination may result in increased risk of cardiovascular adverse events associated with salmeterol, including QT prolongation, palpitations, and sinus tachycardia.



Inhaled/Nasal Steroids:





Fluticasone
↑ Fluticasone
Concomitant use of fluticasone propionate and APTIVUS/ritonavir may increase plasma concentrations of fluticasone propionate, resulting in significantly reduced serum cortisol concentrations.  Co-administration of fluticasone propionate and APTIVUS/ritonavir is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects.



Narcotic Analgesics:






Combinations with APTIVUS/ritonavir not studied
Dosage increase and long-term use of meperidine are not recommended due to increased concentrations of the metabolite normeperidine which has both analgesic activity and CNS stimulant activity (e.g., seizures).


Meperidine 
↓ Meperidine, ↑ Normeperidine


Methadone
↓ Methadone
Dosage of methadone may need to be increased when co-administered with APTIVUS and 200 mg of ritonavir.



↓ S-Methadone, ↓ R-Methadone




Oral Contraceptives/Estrogens:





Ethinyl estradiol
↓ Ethinyl estradiol concentrations by 50%
Alternative methods of nonhormonal contraception should be used when estrogen based oral contraceptives are co-administered with APTIVUS and 200 mg of ritonavir.  Patients using estrogens as hormone replacement therapy should be clinically monitored for signs of estrogen deficiency. Women using estrogens may have an increased risk of non-serious rash.



Proton Pump Inhibitors:





Omeprazole
↓ Omeprazole, ↔ Tipranavir
Dosage of omeprazole may need to be increased when co-administered with APTIVUS and ritonavir.



PDE-5 Inhibitors:






Only the combination of tadalafil with APTIVUS/ritonavir has been studied (at doses used for treatment of erectile dysfunction).
Co-administration with APTIVUS/ritonavir may result in an increase in PDE-5 inhibitor-associated adverse events, including hypotension, syncope, visual disturbances, and priapism.


SildenafilTadalafilVardenafil
↑ Sildenafil (not studied)↑ Tadalafil with first dose APTIVUS/ritonavir ↔ Tadalafil at APTIVUS/ritonavir steady-state ↑ Vardenafil (not studied)

Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH):

Use of sildenafil (Revatio) is contraindicated when used for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [see Contraindications (4)
].
The following dose adjustments are recommended for use of tadalafil (Adcirca) with APTIVUS/ritonavir:






Co-administration of tadalafil (Adcirca) in patients on APTIVUS/ritonavir:





In patients receiving APTIVUS/ritonavir for at least one week, start Adcirca at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.





Co-administration of APTIVUS/ritonavir in patients on tadalafil (Adcirca):





Avoid use of tadalafil (Adcirca) during the initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir. Stop Adcirca at least 24 hours prior to starting APTIVUS/ritonavir. After at least one week following the initiation of APTIVUS/ritonavir, resume Adcirca at 20 mg once daily. Increase to 40 mg once daily based upon individual tolerability.





Use of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction:





Concomitant use of PDE-5 inhibitors with APTIVUS/ritonavir should be used with caution and in no case should the starting dose of: 									
sildenafil exceed 25 mg within 48 hours 
tadalafil exceed 10 mg every 72 hours
vardenafil exceed 2.5 mg every 72 hours

In vitro, nilutamide has been shown to inhibit the activity of liver cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes and, therefore, may reduce the metabolism of compounds requiring these systems.
Consequently, drugs with a low therapeutic margin, such as vitamin K antagonists, phenytoin, and theophylline, could have a delayed elimination and increases in their serum half-life leading to a toxic level. The dosage of these drugs or others with a similar metabolism may need to be modified if they are administered concomitantly with nilutamide. For example, when vitamin K antagonists are administered concomitantly with nilutamide, prothrombin time should be carefully monitored and, if necessary, the dosage of vitamin K antagonists should be reduced."

Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein


Because nefazodone is highly bound to plasma protein (see 

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY


,


 Pharmacokinetics

), administration of nefazodone to a patient taking another drug that is highly protein bound may cause increased free concentrations of the other drug, potentially resulting in adverse events. Conversely, adverse effects could result from displacement of nefazodone by other highly bound drugs.
Warfarin – There were no effects on the prothrombin or bleeding times or upon the pharmacokinetics of R-warfarin when nefazodone (200 mg BID) was administered for 1 week to subjects who had been pretreated for 2 weeks with warfarin. Although the coadministration of nefazodone did decrease the subjects’ exposure to S-warfarin by 12%, the lack of effects on the prothrombin and bleeding times indicates this modest change is not clinically significant. Although these results suggest no adjustments in warfarin dosage are required when nefazodone is administered to patients stabilized on warfarin, such patients should be monitored as required by standard medical practices.









CNS-Active Drugs


Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors – See 
WARNINGS
.
Haloperidol – When a single oral 5 mg dose of haloperidol was coadministered with nefazodone (200 mg BID) at steady state, haloperidol apparent clearance decreased by 35% with no significant increase in peak haloperidol plasma concentrations or time of peak. This change is of unknown clinical significance. Pharmacodynamic effects of haloperidol were generally not altered significantly. There were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for nefazodone. Dosage adjustment of haloperidol may be necessary when coadministered with nefazodone.
Lorazepam – When lorazepam (2 mg BID) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were coadministered to steady state, there was no change in any pharmacokinetic parameter for either drug compared to each drug administered alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.
Triazolam/Alprazolam – See 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
.
Alcohol – Although nefazodone did not potentiate the cognitive and psychomotor effects of alcohol in experiments with normal subjects, the concomitant use of nefazodone and alcohol in depressed patients is not advised.
Buspirone – In a study of steady-state pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, coadministration of buspirone (2.5 or 5 mg BID) with nefazodone (250 mg BID) resulted in marked increases in plasma buspirone concentrations (increases up to 20 fold in Cmax and up to 50 fold in AUC) and statistically significant decreases (about 50%) in plasma concentrations of the buspirone metabolite 1-pyrimidinylpiperazine. With 5 mg BID doses of buspirone, slight increases in AUC were observed for nefazodone (23%) and its metabolites hydroxynefazodone (17%) and mCPP (9%). Subjects receiving nefazodone 250 mg BID and buspirone 5 mg BID experienced lightheadedness, asthenia, dizziness, and somnolence, adverse events also observed with either drug alone. If the two drugs are to be used in combination, a low dose of buspirone (e.g., 2.5 mg QD) is recommended. Subsequent dose adjustment of either drug should be based on clinical assessment.

CONTRAINDICATIONS
, 
WARNINGS
, and 
PRECAUTIONS
, Pharmacokinetics of Nefazodone in ‘Poor Metabolizers’ and Potential Interaction With Drugs That Inhibit and/or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes.

Fluoxetine – When fluoxetine (20 mg QD) and nefazodone (200 mg BID) were administered at steady state there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters for fluoxetine or its metabolite, norfluoxetine. Similarly, there were no changes in the pharmacokinetic parameters of nefazodone or HO-NEF; however, the mean AUC levels of the nefazodone metabolites mCPP and triazole-dione increased by 3 to 6 fold and 1.3 fold, respectively. When a 200 mg dose of nefazodone was administered to subjects who had been receiving fluoxetine for 1 week, there was an increased incidence of transient adverse events such as headache, lightheadedness, nausea, or paresthesia, possibly due to the elevated mCPP levels. Patients who are switched from fluoxetine to nefazodone without an adequate washout period may experience similar transient adverse events. The possibility of this happening can be minimized by allowing a washout period before initiating nefazodone therapy and by reducing the initial dose of nefazodone. Because of the long half-life of fluoxetine and its metabolites, this washout period may range from one to several weeks depending on the dose of fluoxetine and other individual patient variables.
Phenytoin – Pretreatment for 7 days with 200 mg BID of nefazodone had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg oral dose of phenytoin. However, due to the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of phenytoin, the failure to observe a significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of phenytoin does not preclude the possibility of a clinically significant interaction with nefazodone when phenytoin is dosed chronically. However, no change in the initial dosage of phenytoin is considered necessary and any subsequent adjustment of phenytoin dosage should be guided by usual clinical practices.
Desipramine – When nefazodone (150 mg BID) and desipramine (75 mg QD) were administered together there were no changes in the pharmacokinetics of desipramine or its metabolite, 2-hydroxy desipramine. There were also no changes in the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone or its triazole-dione metabolite, but the AUC and Cmax of mCPP increased by 44% and 48%, respectively, while the AUC of HO-NEF decreased by 19%. No changes in doses of either nefazodone or desipramine are necessary when the two drugs are given concomitantly. Subsequent dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.
Lithium – In 13 healthy subjects the coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) with lithium (500 mg BID) for 5 days (steady-state conditions) was found to be well tolerated. When the two drugs were coadministered, there were no changes in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either lithium, nefazodone, or its metabolite HO-NEF; however, there were small decreases in the steady-state plasma concentrations of two nefazodone metabolites, mCPP and triazole-dione, which are considered not to be of clinical significance. Therefore, no dosage adjustment of either lithium or nefazodone is required when they are coadministered.
Carbamazepine – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) for 5 days to 12 healthy subjects on carbamazepine who had achieved steady state (200 mg BID) was found to be well tolerated. Steady-state conditions for carbamazepine, nefazodone, and several of their metabolites were achieved by day 5 of coadministration. With coadministration of the two drugs there were significant increases in the steady-state Cmax and AUC of carbamazepine (23% and 23%, respectively), while the steady-state Cmax and the AUC of the carbamazepine metabolite, 10,11 epoxycarbamazepine, decreased by 21% and 20%, respectively. The coadministration of the two drugs significantly reduced the steady-state Cmax and AUC of nefazodone by 86% and 93%, respectively. Similar reductions in the Cmax and AUC of HO-NEF were also observed (85% and 94%), while the reductions in Cmax and AUC of mCPP and triazole-dione were more modest (13% and 44% for the former and 28% and 57% for the latter). Due to the potential for coadministration of carbamazepine to result in insufficient plasma nefazodone and hydroxynefazodone concentrations for achieving an antidepressant effect for nefazodone, it is recommended that nefazodone not be used in combination with carbamazepine (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
).
General Anesthetics – Little is known about the potential for interaction between nefazodone and general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, nefazodone hydrochloride should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.
Other CNS-Active Drugs – The use of nefazodone in combination with other CNS-active drugs has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, caution is advised if concomitant administration of nefazodone and such drugs is required.









Cimetidine


When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and cimetidine (300 mg QID) were coadministered for one week, no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or cimetidine was observed compared to each dosed alone. Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.









Theophylline


When nefazodone (200 mg BID) was given to patients being treated with theophylline (600 to 1200 mg/day) for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there was no change in the steady-state pharmacokinetics of either nefazodone or theophylline. FEV1 measurements taken when theophylline and nefazodone were coadministered did not differ from baseline dosage (i.e., when theophylline was administered alone). Therefore, dosage adjustment is not necessary for either drug when coadministered.









Cardiovascular-Active Drugs


Digoxin – When nefazodone (200 mg BID) and digoxin (0.2 mg QD) were coadministered for 9 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18) who were phenotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of digoxin were increased by 29%, 27%, and 15%, respectively. Digoxin had no effects on the pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its active metabolites. Because of the narrow therapeutic index of digoxin, caution should be exercised when nefazodone and digoxin are coadministered; plasma level monitoring for digoxin is recommended.
Propranolol – The coadministration of nefazodone (200 mg BID) and propranolol (40 mg BID) for 5.5 days to healthy male volunteers (n = 18), including 3 poor and 15 extensive CYP2D6 metabolizers, resulted in 30% and 14% reductions in Cmax and AUC of propranolol, respectively, and a 14% reduction in Cmax for the metabolite, 4-hydroxypropranolol. The kinetics of nefazodone, hydroxynefazodone, and triazole-dione were not affected by coadministration of propranolol. However, Cmax, Cmin, and AUC of m-chlorophenylpiperazine were increased by 23%, 54%, and 28%, respectively. No change in initial dose of either drug is necessary and dose adjustments should be made on the basis of clinical response.
HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors – When single 40 mg doses of simvastatin or atorvastatin, both substrates of CYP3A4, were given to healthy adult volunteers who had received nefazodone hydrochloride, 200 mg BID for 6 days, approximately 20 fold increases in plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid and 3 to 4 fold increases in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin and atorvastatin lactone were seen. These effects appear to be due to the inhibition of CYP3A4 by nefazodone because, in the same study, nefazodone had no significant effect on the plasma concentrations of pravastatin, which is not metabolized by CYP3A4 to a clinically significant extent.
There have been rare reports of rhabdomyolysis involving patients receiving the combination of nefazodone and either simvastatin or lovastatin, also a substrate of CYP3A4 (see 



ADVERSE REACTIONS


, 


Postintroduction Clinical Experience



). Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in patients receiving HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors administered alone (at recommended dosages) and in particular, for certain drugs in this class, when given in combination with inhibitors of the CYP3A4 isozyme.
Caution should be used if nefazodone is administered in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that are metabolized by CYP3A4, such as simvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin, and dosage adjustments of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are recommended. Since metabolic interactions are unlikely between nefazodone and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that undergo little or no metabolism by the CYP3A4 isozyme, such as pravastatin or fluvastatin, dosage adjustments should not be necessary.









Immunosuppressive Agents


There have been reports of increased blood concentrations of cyclosporine and tacrolimus into toxic ranges when patients received these drugs concomitantly with nefazodone. Both cyclosporine and tacrolimus are substrates of CYP3A4, and nefazodone is known to inhibit this enzyme. If either cyclosporine or tacrolimus is administered with nefazodone, blood concentrations of the immunosuppressive agent should be monitored and dosage adjusted accordingly.









Pharmacokinetics of Nefazodone in ‘Poor Metabolizers’ and Potential Interaction with Drugs That Inhibit and/or Are Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Isozymes


CYP3A4 Isozyme – Nefazodone has been shown in vitro to be an inhibitor of CYP3A4. This is consistent with the interactions observed between nefazodone and triazolam, alprazolam, buspirone, atorvastatin, and simvastatin, drugs metabolized by this isozyme. Consequently, caution is indicated in the combined use of nefazodone with any drugs known to be metabolized by CYP3A4. In particular, the combined use of nefazodone with triazolam should be avoided for most patients, including the elderly. The combined use of nefazodone with terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, or pimozide is contraindicated (see 
CONTRAINDICATIONS and 
WARNINGS
).
CYP2D6 Isozyme – A subset (3% to 10%) of the population has reduced activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme CYP2D6. Such individuals are referred to commonly as “poor metabolizers” of drugs such as debrisoquin, dextromethorphan, and the tricyclic antidepressants. The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone and its major metabolites are not altered in these “poor metabolizers.” Plasma concentrations of one minor metabolite (mCPP) are increased in this population; the adjustment of nefazodone dosage is not required when administered to “poor metabolizers.” Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro to be extremely weak inhibitors of CYP2D6. Thus, it is not likely that nefazodone will decrease the metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by this isozyme.
CYP1A2 Isozyme – Nefazodone and its metabolites have been shown in vitro not to inhibit CYP1A2. Thus, metabolic interactions between nefazodone and drugs metabolized by this isozyme are unlikely.









Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)


There are no clinical studies of the combined use of ECT and nefazodone."

7.1 Effect of DIACOMIT on Other Drugs


CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C19, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP) Substrates

In vitro data show that stiripentol is both an inhibitor and inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, and CYP3A4. Because of potential drug-drug interactions, consider dose adjustment of CYP1A2 substrates (e.g., theophylline, caffeine), CYP2B6 substrates (e.g., sertraline, thiotepa), and CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., midazolam, triazolam, quinidine), as clinically appropriate, when administered concomitantly with DIACOMIT.
Because of potential inhibition of enzyme/transporter activity, consider a reduction in dosage of substrates of CYP2C8, CYP2C19 (e.g., diazepam, clopidogrel), P-gp (e.g., carbamazepine), and BCRP (e.g., methotrexate, prazosin, glyburide), if adverse reactions are experienced when administered concomitantly with DIACOMIT.

Clobazam
Co-administration of DIACOMIT (which inhibits CYP 3A4 and 2C19) with clobazam results in increased plasma concentrations of clobazam (a substrate of CYP3A4) and norclobazam, the active metabolite of clobazam (a substrate of CYP2C19) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. This may increase the risk of clobazam-related adverse reactions. Consider a reduction in dosage of clobazam if adverse reactions are experienced when co-administered with DIACOMIT [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].









7.2 Effect of Other Drugs on DIACOMIT

Induction-based interactions leading to decreases in DIACOMIT concentrations are possible when co-administered with a potent CYP1A2, CYP3A4, or CYP2C19 inducer, such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital and carbamazepine, as these enzymes all metabolize stiripentol. Concomitant use of strong inducers with DIACOMIT should be avoided, or dosage adjustments should be made.

[see Dosage and Administration (2), Contraindications (4)
 and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Rilpivirine is primarily metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A, and drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may thus affect the clearance of rilpivirine. Coadministration of EDURANT and drugs that induce CYP3A may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs. Coadministration of EDURANT and drugs that inhibit CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. Coadministration of EDURANT with drugs that increase gastric pH may result in decreased plasma concentrations of rilpivirine and loss of virologic response and possible resistance to rilpivirine or to the class of NNRTIs.
EDURANT at a dose of 25 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the exposure of drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes.
Table 5 shows the established and other potentially significant drug interactions based on which alterations in dose or regimen of EDURANT and/or coadministered drug may be recommended. Drugs that are not recommended for coadministration with EDURANT are also included in Table 5.

Concomitant use of EDURANT with lopinavir/ritonavir may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). No dose adjustment is required when EDURANT is coadministered with lopinavir/ritonavir.


other boosted PIs (atazanavir/ritonavir, fosamprenavir/ritonavir, saquinavir/ritonavir, tipranavir/ritonavir)
↑ rilpivirine↔ boosted PI
Concomitant use of EDURANT with boosted PIs may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). EDURANT is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of coadministered PIs.


unboosted PIs (atazanavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir)
↑ rilpivirine↔ unboosted PI
Concomitant use of EDURANT with unboosted PIs may cause an increase in the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine (inhibition of CYP3A enzymes). EDURANT is not expected to affect the plasma concentrations of coadministered PIs.



Macrolide or ketolide antibiotics:
azithromycinclarithromycinerythromycin
↑ rilpivirine↔ azithromycin↔ clarithromycin↔ erythromycin

Macrolides are expected to increase concentrations of rilpivirine and are associated with a risk of Torsade de Pointes [Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Where possible, consider alternatives, such as azithromycin, which increases rilpivirine concentrations less than other macrolides.



Narcotic Analgesics:
methadone

↓ R(-) methadone↓ S(+) methadone
No dose adjustments are required when initiating coadministration of methadone with EDURANT. However, clinical monitoring is recommended as methadone maintenance therapy may need to be adjusted in some patients.



Proton Pump Inhibitors:
e.g., esomeprazolelansoprazoleomeprazolepantoprazolerabeprazole
↓Rilpivirine
Coadministration is contraindicated with EDURANT [see Contraindications (4)].



In addition to the drugs included in Table 5, the interaction between EDURANT and the following drugs was evaluated in clinical studies and no dose adjustment is needed for either drug [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]: acetaminophen, atorvastatin, chlorzoxazone, cabotegravir, ethinylestradiol, norethindrone, raltegravir, sildenafil, simeprevir and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Rilpivirine did not have a clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin or metformin. No clinically relevant drug-drug interaction is expected when EDURANT is coadministered with maraviroc, ribavirin or the NRTIs abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine, stavudine and zidovudine.






Consider alternatives to EDURANT when coadministered with drugs with a known risk of torsade de pointes. (5.4)
 EDURANT should not be used in combination with NNRTIs. (4, 7)
Coadministration of EDURANT with drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A may affect the plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (4, 7)
Coadministration of EDURANT with drugs that increase gastric pH may decrease plasma concentrations of rilpivirine. (4, 7)
 Refer to the Full Prescribing Information for other drugs that should not be coadministered with EDURANT and for other drugs that may require a change in dose or regimen. (7)










QT Prolonging Drugs

There is limited information available on the potential for a pharmacodynamic interaction between rilpivirine and drugs that prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram. In a study of healthy subjects, 75 mg once daily and 300 mg once daily (3 times and 12 times the dose in EDURANT) have been shown to prolong the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Consider alternatives to EDURANT when coadministered with a drug with a known risk of torsade de pointes."

Coadministration of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors may increase nintedanib exposure. Monitor patients closely for tolerability of OFEV. (7.1)








7.1  P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and CYP3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Nintedanib is a substrate of P-gp and, to a minor extent, CYP3A4 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole, increased exposure to nintedanib by 60%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin) with OFEV may increase exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. In such cases, patients should be monitored closely for tolerability of OFEV. Management of adverse reactions may require interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation of therapy with OFEV [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].
Coadministration with oral doses of a P-gp and CYP3A4 inducer, rifampicin, decreased exposure to nintedanib by 50%. Concomitant use of P-gp and CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, phenytoin, and St. John's wort) with OFEV should be avoided as these drugs may decrease exposure to nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].









7.2  Anticoagulants

Nintedanib is a VEGFR inhibitor and may increase the risk of bleeding. Monitor patients on full anticoagulation therapy closely for bleeding and adjust anticoagulation treatment as necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)].









7.3  Pirfenidone

In a multiple-dose study conducted to assess the pharmacokinetic effects of concomitant treatment with nintedanib and pirfenidone, the coadministration of nintedanib with pirfenidone did not alter the exposure of either agent [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary during concomitant administration of nintedanib with pirfenidone.








7.4  Bosentan

Coadministration of nintedanib with bosentan did not alter the pharmacokinetics of nintedanib [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]."
